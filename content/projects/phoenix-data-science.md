# Motivation

One of the biggest problems that is facing the data science industry is the cost of utilizing data. The cost of utilization can be broken down into a few components:

* **Data collection**: physical sensors, human collectors, automatic collectors of data. Privacy and security are a huge concern
* **Data analysis**: crunching the numbers in the data, identifying trends and verifing that trends are statistically significant
* **Data-driven actions**: deriving and acting upon insight

There is a significant cost when it comes to labour and time. Unfortunately, this means that startups and non-profits, despite the data they have collected, are not in the optimal position to analyze the data.

Enter Phoenix Data Consulting. This is an idea that I have been toying around with since I my first internship at a data science startup. Using the resources and experience of University of Waterloo students, we could offer pro-bono data consulting services specifically for startups and non-profits.

# What have we done so far?

Currently, we are developing visualization software for a non-profit client and scoping out requirements for another high-growth startup.

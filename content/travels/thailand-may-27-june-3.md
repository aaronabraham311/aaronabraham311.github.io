# May 28

On our first full day in Chiang Mai, we decided to go on a walking tour of the old city to better understand the city and culture. From our tour guide, we learned about the unique culture of Chiang Mai. Chiang Mai used to be the center of the Lanna Kingdom, a completely separate entity from the rest of the Thai kingdom. The Lanna people have an interesting mix of culture from Burmese, Thai, Lao and Chinese people, which makes them an especially unique part of Thailand. The Lanna Kingdom was conquered by the Thai kingdom and Lanna culture was suppressed to ensure homogeneity in the kingdom. However, the Thai kingdom has preserved a lot of the cultural monuments in Chiang Mai, which we explored for half the day. We also visited food stalls and many Buddhist temples (Buddhism is a very important part of Thai culture).

Afterwards, from the recommendation of our tour guide, we checked out Huen Phen, a restaurant that specializes in Northern Thai cuisine. I was especially excited to try out Northern Thai cuisine since it is very rare to find in North America. I got the khao soi dish, a quintessential Northern Thai noodle soup. IT. WAS. FIRE. Extremely cheap, high ingredient quality and far more flavorful than any other food I had on my grad trip so far. 

After the scrumptious meal, we went back to our hotel to chill and recuperate from the brutal Thai heat. I had signed up our group for a cooking class from Mama Noi Cookery School, who picked us up in a military-style Jeep and brought us to a market. A chef then walked us through the open-stall market and showed us various Thai ingredients, like lemongrass and galangal. We then made our way to the school and started cheffing up various dishes and made Thai iced tea. This was my first time cooking Thai food and I found it to be an interesting experience. I learned a lot about the different spices and how Thai cuisine has to be specially prepared. I got a bunch of tips and a recipe book so I hope to experiment around in my free time with some Thai recipes! I personally made shrimp tom yum soup, a chicken basil stir fry, khao soi and a mango sticky rice pudding.

# May 29

On this day, we visited Doi Inthanon National Park, a well-known mountainous area 2 hours away from Chiang Mai. We booked a group tour and promptly was whisked away into the mountains. 

Our first stop was Wachirathan Waterfall, a beautiful display of the strength of the monsoon-filled rivers tumbling from heights. Compared to the waterfalls in Taiwan, we were a lot closer to it, so we could actually feel the spray from the water falling. Our guide told us that the time that we chose to visit Thailand was perfect to see the waterfall as the monsoon rains just started hitting the area; it was previously bone-dry. 

After the waterfall, we drove into the clouds to visit Doi Inthanon, the highest spot in all of Thailand. Since it was incredibly cloudy, the mountain was quite wet, but it made the experience really beautiful. There are a few small shrines we explored and a small nature trail. I would recommend tourists visiting Doi Inthanon to avoid coming during the monsoon season as you cannot see much asides from the nearby rainforests. 

We then visited the Grand Pagodas, which are two massive pagodas erected nearby. The pagodas were built by the King to honour one of his wives. We tried to explore the pagodas but due to the height and the incessant monsoon clouds, it became extremely wet and windy, so it wasn't great to explore.

We then visited a nearby Lanna village to get lunch and learned about the traditional way of life for the rural population. Many of the farmers... 

**A note to readers**: I became lazy and didn't finish this post soon after the trip. I don't really remember much of the day-to-day shenanigans in Thailand now that I am coming back to this. Thus, I am going to briefly summarize the rest of the trip and try to give out some tips to round out this post:
- Bangkok: we didn't spend too much time in Bangkok unfortunately. We did check out the Grand Palace, but found it extremely crowded and quite uncomfortable due to humidity and heat. Definitely not my favorite place during my grad trip
- Krabi: Krabi is the lesser-known southern Thai city and much more peaceful than Phuket. In Krabi, we took a tour to Phi Phi Islands where we snorkelled in the Indian Ocean and visited some spectacular beaches
- Phuket: We didn't spend too much time in Phuket; mostly eating food and checking out nearby attractions. By this time in the trip, I was fully ready to go home.

# Tips
- Do not trust street food in Thailand. I fortunately did not get sick, but that was because:
	- I religiously avoided street food or any food that was washed (eg. fruits)
	- I was taking probiotics throughout this trip to avoid any nasty stomach scenarios
- 7-11 is quite convenient in Thailand. It is not nearly as nice as it is in Japan, but you can trust the quality of the food in there.
- Beware of scams. We booked things well in advance and avoided last-minute bookings with local agencies
- Before you go to Thailand, I would recommend checking with your doctor if there are any vaccinations that you may need
- Try out different food in different regions of Thailand; there is a lot of regional diversity. In the west, we mainly get central Thai food, but the other regions have some showstoppers as well
- I heard some great things about Koh Lanta. Do your due diligence when choosing which islands/areas to visit in southern Thailand, as they all have different vibes

On our first full day in Chiang Mai, we decided to go on a walking tour of the old city to better understand the city and culture. From our tour guide, we learned about the unique culture of Chiang Mai. Chiang Mai used to be the center of the Lanna Kingdom, a completely separate entity from the rest of the Thai kingdom. The Lanna people have an interesting mix of culture from Burmese, Thai, Lao and Chinese people, which makes them an especially unique part of Thailand. The Lanna Kingdom was conquered by the Thai kingdom and Lanna culture was suppressed to ensure homogeneity in the kingdom. However, the Thai kingdom has preserved a lot of the cultural monuments in Chiang Mai, which we explored for half the day. We also visited food stalls and many Buddhist temples (Buddhism is a very important part of Thai culture).

Afterwards, from the recommendation of our tour guide, we checked out Huen Phen, a restaurant that specializes in Northern Thai cuisine. I was especially excited to try out Northern Thai cuisine since it is very rare to find in North America. I got the khao soi dish, a quintessential Northern Thai noodle soup. IT. WAS. FIRE. Extremely cheap, high ingredient quality and far more flavorful than any other food I had on my grad trip so far. 

After the scrumptious meal, we went back to our hotel to chill and recuperate from the brutal Thai heat. I had signed up our group for a cooking class from Mama Noi Cookery School, who picked us up in a military-style Jeep and brought us to a market. A chef then walked us through the open-stall market and showed us various Thai ingredients, like lemongrass and galangal. We then made our way to the school and started cheffing up various dishes and made Thai iced tea. This was my first time cooking Thai food and I found it to be an interesting experience. I learned a lot about the different spices and how Thai cuisine has to be specially prepared. I got a bunch of tips and a recipe book so I hope to experiment around in my free time with some Thai recipes! I personally made shrimp tom yum soup, a chicken basil stir fry, khao soi and a mango sticky rice pudding.

On this day, we visited Doi Inthanon National Park, a well-known mountainous area 2 hours away from Chiang Mai. We booked a group tour and promptly was whisked away into the mountains. 

Our first stop was Wachirathan Waterfall, a beautiful display of the strength of the monsoon-filled rivers tumbling from heights. Compared to the waterfalls in Taiwan, we were a lot closer to it, so we could actually feel the spray from the water falling. Our guide told us that the time that we chose to visit Thailand was perfect to see the waterfall as the monsoon rains just started hitting the area; it was previously bone-dry. 

After the waterfall, we drove into the clouds to visit Doi Inthanon, the highest spot in all of Thailand. Since it was incredibly cloudy, the mountain was quite wet, but it made the experience really beautiful. There are a few small shrines we explored and a small nature trail. I would recommend tourists visiting Doi Inthanon to avoid coming during the monsoon season as you cannot see much asides from the nearby rainforests. 

We then visited the Grand Pagodas, which are two massive pagodas erected nearby. The pagodas were built by the King to honour one of his wives. We tried to explore the pagodas but due to the height and the incessant monsoon clouds, it became extremely wet and windy, so it wasn't great to explore.

We then visited a nearby Lanna village to get lunch and learned about the traditional way of life for the rural population. Many of the farmers

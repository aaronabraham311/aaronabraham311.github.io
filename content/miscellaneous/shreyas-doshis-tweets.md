The following are my notes on some of Shreyas Doshi's tweets. I'm not a fan of Twitter but I really enjoy reading his incisive content; hence these notes.

## Why smart teams lead to products with mediocre/no impact

* Execution orientation fallacy:
  * We make suboptimal decisions because we judge initiatives based off what we can easily execute today
  * Eg: bias towards building small improvements over new products just because we can easily execute on small improvements
* Bias-for-building fallacy:
  * Don't take time to understand determinants of product success (eg. market, user needs, domain, competitors) because we bias for 'action'
* IKEA effect for products
  * Base current product execution on past product decisions, even though these decisions might be flawed
  * Actual IKEA effect: people place more value on things which they built themselves
* Focusing illusion for products
  * Any problem that you discuss with users feels more urgent than actuality
  * You're effectively ignoring other parts of person's life, which are probably more important
* Maslow's Hammer
  * Use framework/skill/proxy in every situation, even though it might not have any utility
  * "When someone has a hammer, everything looks like a nail"
* Authority approval bias
  * We devise plans/features/products based on expected approval from seniors
* Russian roulette for products
  * Don't account for situations which can have catastrophic consequences
* Onus on management to identify and correct

## Good PMs, Great PMs

* Good PMs deliver quality products. Great PMs improve company trajectory via great products
* Good PMs take data-driven decisions. Great PMs take data-informed decisions
  * Distinction? Great PMs will use qualitative data as well and will use either pieces of data when situation calls for a specific type
* Good PMs extensively research domain of product. Great PMs are world-class expert
  * Great PMs, when bootstrapping product, will use counsel of world-class experts to become experts themselves
* Good PMs use user research for UI fixes. Great PMs use a variety of user research techniques for various different purposes. Most important: figuring out what to build
* Good PMs use data and logic to lay out their plan. Great PMs use people's emotions as well, since emotions drive much of our daily decisions
* Good PMs know it's important to talk to customers frequently. Great PMs know it's important to listen to customers frequently

* Good PMs make convincing arguments for their view. Great PMs make convincing arguments for opposing views
* Good PMs write detailed PRDs, great PMs iterate on PRDs to prevent blocks
* Good PMs work hard but are overwhelmed. Great PMs work hard on high-leverage tasks, delegating everything else
* Good PMs converge on trusted set of tools to deal with any problem. Great PMs are more adaptive
* Good PMs sacrifice tech debt for customer features. Great PMs would advocate for reducing tech debt
* Good PMs provide thoughtful answers to execs in meetings. Great PMs would seek to reframe questions to undercover truth
* Good PMs deal with answers and data. Great PMs deal with questions and wisdom
* Good PMs are great problem solvers. Great PMs are great problem preventers and prioritizers
* Good PMs try to get optimal results for a strategy. Great PMs try to ensure they have an optimal strategy in the first place
* Good PMs can explain strategy in an elevator ride. Great PMs ensures entire team can explain strategy in an elevator ride
* Good PMs thank builders. Great PMs also thank enablers (marketing, sales, support...)
* Good PMs do retros. Great PMs do retros and shares lesson with other teams
* Good PMs get approval from all stakeholders. Great PMs get advice from all stakeholders as well
* Good PMs follow company product principles. Great PMs fix product principles before following
* Good PMs will do everything in power to meet team goals. Great PMs known when to sacrific team goals for company progress
* Good PMs are students of the PM career ladder. Great PMs care more about competence and impact

## Why Smart Organizations Make Stupid Mistakes

* Usually, dumb mistakes are not because of stupidity or malice
* Prevantable problem paradox: any complex organization over time will tend to incentive problem creation over problem prevention
* Why does this paradox occur?
  * Saving the org after a problem occurs generates a lot more publicity and praise since it looks difficult
  * Problem prevention looks easy, boring and get no acclaim at all
  * Eg: would you rather watch a movie where captain hit iceberg and saved all passengers or captain moves around the iceberg, preventing the issue in the first place?
* How to prevent paradox:
  * Create awareness of it's existence
  * Change team's norms for recognizing impact to also take into account for problem prevention
  * Embrace pre-mortems: [https://coda.io/@shreyas/pre-mortems-how-a-stripe-product-manager-predicts-prevents-probl](https://coda.io/@shreyas/pre-mortems-how-a-stripe-product-manager-predicts-prevents-probl)
  * Advocate for changing reward systems

## Clear Writing

* Answer the following questions
*
  * What am I really trying to say?
  * Why should people care?
  * What is the most important point?
  * What is the easiest way to understand the most important point?
  * How do I want the reader to feel?
  * What should the reader do next?

## Skills for Success

* Talent stacking: collect more skills rather than always polishing one
  * Much easier to learn skills and become top 25% performer than to master skill to become top 1% performer
  * Combination of skills is rare and can give you 'superpowers'
* High agency: finding a way to get what you want without waiting for perfect circumstances or complaining about bad circumstances
  * Game changers are extraordinary and should be hired if possible

* Clear thinking
* Deep work:
* Transactional analysis

## A B2B Product Story

* Story: new product idea that apparently solves user needs. Once built, adoption is anemic. Spent years of wasted efforts trying to improve and ultimately sunsetted
* Why did this happen:
  * Product shouldn't have been built in the first place
  * Product was ill-conceived and original sin could not be removed afterwards
* For the first reason: this is purely because of focusing illusion
  * If you force the customers to prioritize your product, you get whack results
* How to overcome?
  * User interviews should be far more objective. This is not the time to confirm product ideas or exec mandate
  * Stack rank problems to determine if this problem is even worth solving

## Why B2B Is Tough

* Too many B2B products start with assumption that businesses badly need their product. PMs then think they need to prioritize requests, improve usability and build. Wrong
* Start from a null hypothesis that businesses _don't_ need your product and determine what needs to be true in order to reject the null hypothesis
* Questions to think about to avoid B2B failure:
  * What acute customer problems does your product solve?
  * Why would they pick your product over alternatives
  * Why would they change ingrained habits to accomodate your product?
  * Will these answers be true for enough customers?
* The alternative for your product is not another product; it is inaction or a spreadsheet

## Tactics to Improve Products

* Talk to customers
* Use the product
* Understand the competition
* Browse support tickets
* Shadow a sales call
* Specify adoption metrics
* Write a user story
* List top user annoyances
* Read the website like a novice
* Go through the NUX (new user experience)

## Growing as a product person

* Tips:
  * Create a habit of deep work
  * Build more user empathy
  * Become a domain expert
  * Understand good design
  * Spec out your skill stack
  * Get more even keeled
  * Learn negotiation
  * Know the basics of statistics
  * Enhance listening
  * Improve writing
* You shouldn't spend 100% of your career time working on projects. Dedicate a significant portion (20%) on skill improvement so that the remaining part for project work becomes significantly more effective

## Metrics primer

* Product metric categories:
  * Health metrics: is the product available at performing at a level that users would expect?
    * Eg: latency, load time, uptime, request errors
  * Usage metrics: how are users using the product?
    * Eg: time-of-day/week trends, top N actions, funnel metrics, help doc usage, retention, password reset rate
  * Adoption metrics: is the product and key features as much as we hoped and in the ways that we like?
    * Eg: DAU, MAU, DAU:MAU, N of M day usage, feature adoption trends, paid conversion
  * Satisfaction metrics: what is the overall sentiment of users towards product?
    * Eg: overall CSAT, new feature CSAT, support CSAT
  * Ecosystem metrics: what is the macro state of your product in the domain?
    * Eg: share of wallet, 3rd party integrations, industry rank, marketshare for target segments, % of TAM
  * Outcome metrics: what overall results are we seeing from this product?
    * Eg: revenue, margin, revenue/customer, active users, marketshare, transactions
* Be intentional of which categories you care about
* A metric can be in multiple categories for your product
* You want to keep track of multiple metrics (esp. usage metrics), but prioritize 3-5 for key metrics that serve as indicators if your product is meeting the proposed strategy & goals
  * Rule of thumb: one metric for acquisition, retention, engagement and monetization
  * Might not be able to move all metrics forward at once, so prioritize what is most important
  * Criteria:
    * Responsive to product changes
    * Aggregate measure of product's value to users
    * Can be readily tied to business value
    * Expected to be long-lasting
* Typically, you create your annual goals around your key metrics
* Sometimes your key metrics are lagging indicators of success. You want to also keep 3-5 metrics as leading metrics
  * Might change far more frequently than key metrics
* Treat your dashboard as a product and keep track of its usage. Frequently check and can even set up email reports
* Remember to be data informed over data driven. Don't let metrics decide everything for you

## Product biases

* Learning and studying biases is important because they make or break decisions
* You do not rise to the level of your plan; you fall to the level of your decision-making
  * You do not rise to the level of your OKRs; you fall to the level of your execution
  * You do not rise to the level of your annual targets; you fall to the level of your strategy
  * You do not rise to the level of your parallel processing; you fall to the level of your prioritization
* The best team is almost always the one that can make the most effective decisions
* To make good decisions, be clear on what success looks like, understand the inputs, evaluate the options and make a choice while also avoiding bad choices
* Biases to know about:
  * Focusing illusion: when you focus on something, you elevate it's importance
    * This happens too many times during product building as you create a focusing illusion for your customers and they don't convey that the problem isn't important to them
    * Then, we get surprised when customers don't buy the product, because we overestimated the severity of the problem
  * IKEA effect: we value the product too much due to past execution and sunk costs
  * Bias-for-building fallacy: we don't take the time to understand the problem, domain, competitors and other factors because we bias for action. We tell ourselves to iterate and build now
  * Execution orientation fallacy: we create suboptimal decisions because we bias for easy execution, even though other choices might have huge positive impact despite challenges
  * Maslow's Hammer: use some process/metric/proxy over and over again even if the utility is limited in a particular situation
  * Russian roulette for products: don't properly consider scenarios that could lead to catastrophic product failures
    * Use pre-mortems to prevent this
  * Authority approval fallacy: we create strategies based on what would give us easier approval from higher-ups and confirm their understanding of the space (even if its flawed)
* How to prevent falling to these biases:
  * Develop greater self-awareness
  * Add these into your team's shared vocabulary so they are aware of it at all times
  * Remember, band-aids don't fix bullet holes. The best fix is culture shifts, but that takes time. You should create operating principles & core values to counteract biases
  * Deep customer empathy combats the focusing illusion
    * Understand customer's biggest problems and work towards solving them
  * Velocity > speed combats bias for building
    * Sheer speed doesn't really help if it's not in the right direction
  * Cultivate high ambition and agency to avoid execution orientation fallacy
    * Seek impact over convenience and don't wait for things to fall in place
  * Context combats Maslow's Hammer
    * The same tool can help or harm, depending on the context
  * Preventing catastrophe is better than heroics; this principle avoid Russian Roulette
  * To counterract authority approval fallacy, create culture of constructive dissonance
    * Go after the right answer, not to prove yourself right
* Figure out where your team is going wrong and apply these principles and change according to your context

## Product principles

* Before you get all excited about low-hanging fruit, make sure you're standing underneath the right tree
* The "product" isn't just the pixels and buttons on the screen. Treat everything that touches the user as a product and make sure there is cohesion
* Moving fast is important, but also move in the right direction. Avoid backtracking
* If you want to be opinionated, be opinionated on the target customer segment. It's better to create something that is highly resonant for a few people than something for everyone but resonates with no-one
* The chief purpose of user research should be to uncover user motivations
* When evaluating UI/user-facing artifact, remove all context and approach as a beginner
* When a product problem is high-stakes, creative execution is really important
  * Don't just accept the first solution, which is often conventional and safe. Break down to the very essence and try to find more creative ways
* Don't underestimate the value of delightful surprises
* The 3 most important product questions to always ask yourself:
  * Is it serving an implicit/explicit user very well?
  * Is it differentiated enough?
  * Is the market large enough (or will it) to meet business goals?
* Strategy requires creativity as much as analytical chops. Do it with <= 3 people (marketing person, creative product person, eng person)
  * Don't do strategy-by-committee
* Strategy isn't super complicated. Read Porter's 5 Forces, Porter's 3 Generic Strategies and Helmer's 7 Forces
  * Everything else can be built on top of this
* Your product's marketing must answer the following questions:
  * What does it do?
  * How good is it?
  * Is it for me?
  * Wherever your customer first interacts with your product, make sure it answers these questions
* Make sure to always have a floor budget for infra and tech debt
* Product work is both science and art. Use context to guide you
* Product work is all about creating a worthy vision, a shrewd strategy, wisely execute and meet user demands and business goals

## Product prioritization

* Most prioritization problems are strategy problems:
  * Acceptance problem: strategy is not important to teams
  * Creation problem: strategy is important but don't have one
  * Substance problem: strategy is there but it's flawed
  * Communication problem: strategy is not well communicated
* If you think you're working on something which makes no sense, go back to strategy and see if you have any of those problems
* If you solved these problems, use systematic planning:
  * First clarify key themes across company and determine allocation of effort and time
  * Or you can allocate time and effort for different aspects of one product (eg. customer specials, embarrasments, tech debt, ..)
* Requires intuition and user knowledge to know what should be prioritized for effort
* Questions to ask yourself:
  * What do we need to do in the next N months to achieve our strategy?
  * What key risks or liabilities do we need to eliminate?
  * Do we need to play offense or defense in the next N months?
  * Do we need immediate growth, future growth or guarding growth?
  * Are we exploring or exploiting mode?
  * What team processes can help us achieve our goals
  * What key initiatives have the greatest expected value?
  * What is in my control?
* Get feedback from stakeholders, iterate and present allocation of effort to team
* If ideally a bottoms-up team, team can propose features on what would lead to best impact
* As things come up, evaluate against allocation and can use ad-hoc prioritization techniques (like RICE)

## On Listening

* Why is listening hard:
  * Inability to be present
  * Fear of being wrong
  * A desire for validation
  * A feeling of superiority
  * A lack of curiosity
  * Urge to impress
* To speak is craft; to listen is art
* When others are talking, we are constantly interrupting them with our thoughts
* To be a better listener, practice being present and establish a listening pattern
* To be present, train yourself to observe and meditate
* Listening pattern: mention you are open-minded, focus on the gaps between words (apparently very effective) and don't intrepret beyond what is said, break for a few seconds to reflect and then summarize & respond

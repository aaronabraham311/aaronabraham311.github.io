Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I am a software engineer at Ramp based in New York City. I graduated from the University of Waterloo's Software Engineering program in 2024. 

I've done a lot of stuff and have made a decent effort to write about it. Check out:
- [[books|My reading notes]]
- [[co-op|My internship experiences]]
- [[projects|My various projects]]
- [[travels|My travels]]

- [[product-analysis|My ramblings on product and business]]
- [[post-grad-living|My life after university]]

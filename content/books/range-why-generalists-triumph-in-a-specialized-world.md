# The Cult of the Head Start

* We often hear of the Polgar sisters and Tiger Woods and their extraordinary success, which is why many of us believe in early deliberate practice
* However, we must also realize that the majority of things that humans want to do are not like chess or tennis; hard to measure and not objective
* 'Kind' learning environment where the same patterns happen over and over again and feedback is rapid. This is where narrow domain specialization dominates
  * Chunking is important and requires people to start practicing early and excessively, but it is based on past patterns
  * This is exactly where AI rules supreme
* 'Wicked' learning environment: rules are unclear, feedback and patterns might not exist or are incomplete. This is majority of tasks
  * Experience may reinforce the exact wrong lessons
* People that narrow in have traded mastery for flexibility, creating cognitive entrenchment
* Successful adapters always had multiple streams open to specialize
* Many masters in their field have a 'circuit breaker' or an escape activity to help them not get entrenched into one style of thinking

# How the Wicked World Was Made

* Experiments found where modernity actually increased IQ because education gives us general first principles that can apply in several different circumstances
* Exposure to modern work and non-repetitive work has made us smarter than before
* Abstract work is based on the concept of range.
* Specialization in universities has left us out of broad transferable skills that would be useful in life and in other domains
* Example of this broad skill: Fermi problem solving
* Example of villagers in Uzbekistan who could barely comprehend logic questions because it was from a completely different world. Similarly, many of us flounder when presented with a problem from a different domain

# When Less of the Same is More

* Ex: Figlie in Venice were able to learn multiple instruments, coming from an orphaned background, raised in _ospedali_ (orphanages) where they had a lot of other work to do
* Right now, many view music in the lens of focus narrowly and do well. However, the sampling period of trying different instruments is integral and allows the best musicians to choose an instrument that they like (eg. Yo-Yo Ma played piano violin before cello)
* Studies have shown that some of the most musically talented youth have had much less practice and focus on a particular instrument than their peers; in fact, the studies showed that too many lessons and structured activities had a negative impact
* Studies also showed that a sampling period was extremely important for prodigies
* Many improv masters in music experimented a lot and never got formal education on how to read notes or sheet music; they imitated their way to the top
* By switching between instruments, musicians are able to develop abstract models that helps them in mastering any instrument/improvising if they so choose

# Learning, Fast and Slow

* In math classes, there are two types of questions: making connections and making procedures
  * Unfortunately, many Western nations start off with both questions when learning their concepts but only use procedural problems for evaluation
  * For learning that is deep, durable and flexible, fast and easy procedures is not the way
* 'Desirable difficulties': obstacles in learning that make it harder to understand but makes learning much better in the long term
  * Supported by a lot of education research
  * Example is generation, where you are forced to generate an answer even if you have no idea what the answer is
  * Tolerating big mistakes creates a great learning environment
  * Training with hints did not produce any lasting learning
* Testing is another desirable difficulty, but giving hints or answers does not make it effective
* Spacing is another important pedagogical practice: space out learning and testing to encourage actual learning
  * Repetition is less important than struggle
* Studies have also found that teachers who made students struggle more and gave them lower scores were the ones with the most successful students in the long run
  * Students tend to evaluate professor based on current performance, but learning is a much more long-term process. Good performance is actually just indexing fast and fleeting progress
* Interleaving: procedural practice under varied and random conditions
  * Allows students to differentiate different types of problems, also known as mixed practice
  * Due to short-term pain and slow gains in performance, it tricks students into believing that they aren't learning much
* Early learning programs also fall into this same pool: the skill that they learn are repetitive and can be easily replicated. The head start vanishes. Skills should be more open-ended
* Far transfer: knowledge structure flexible enough to be applied in broad, novel domains
  * We should be aiming for this

# Thinking Outside Experience

* Analogical thinking: use conceptual similarities across multiple domains
  * Ex: Kepler used analogical thinking to the extreme to understand what caused the orbits of planets
* Analogies allow us to think through novel problems
  * If problems are never seen before, then we have no experience database to rely on. Instead, we need to consider concepts that we have seen in other domains
  * If problems are seen before, we can apply surface analogy, which is kind learning
* Human intuition is not very good at analogical thinking; we are used to kind learning enviornments where problems and solutions repeat
* We have to encourage using analogies from vastly different domains, not just the surface level domains. This is how we come up with novel solutions
  * Problem is that we are often tempted to just look at the inside view, a cognitive bias
  * We need to defeat this impulse by looking at analogies from outside world
* The more internal details we are given to a problem, the more extreme our judgements
* A full reference class of analogies is often better than a single analogy
* For wicked problems, we need to evaluate the problem before jumping in, so analogical thinking is a big boon
* Best people that solve problems are those that are able to classify the type of problem
* Labs that often have the most breakthrough are ones that are Kepler in nature: they use a wide variety of analogies from different domains and their members are from different domains
* Biggest problem is that there is no entrenched benefit of going broad vs narrow

# The Trouble with Too Much Grit

* J.K. Rowling, Vincent van Gogh, Gaugin are all examples of late starts
* Trade off between late starts and early start is between domain skills vs. knowledge of what type of work you liked best
* Regardless of when switching occured, it boosts growth rate significantly. Switchers win
* Quitting is advantageous when you know that it is not good for you. Winners often quit fast
* Career finding is a multi-armed bandit problem, try to get as much information as possible about all possibilities and then invest in one

# Flirting with Your Possible Selves

* Ex: Frances Hesselbein. Spent majority of her life trying out different things but got CEO of multiple organizations by mid-fifties. Propelled her forwards
* Majority of people actually have a circuitious path to where they are now
  * These 'dark horses' practice something called short-term planning
* Many of us fall for the 'end of history solution': we recognize that we took a winding path to get where we are now but we don't admit that this will continue in the future
* Personality traits are subject of our context: we need to understand which contexts give us the maximum pleasure in our work, i.e. match quality
* We need to try out some of the things that we think is best and then specialize. Long-term plans < short-term experiments
* Flirt with your possibles selves by designing small scale experiments and see if you like it

# The Outsider Advantage

* Several stories of new inventions and creations from people that look at problem from outside and apply techniques from a completely different domain
  * Ex:// invention of canned food, InnoCentive, NASA solar flare prediction
* InnoCentive actually found that the farther away a person's specialization and domain expertise is to the problem, the more likely they were to solve it
* Specialized organizations tend to go for a local search, which is suboptimal
* By widely distributing knowledge, you allow curious people to use their broad range of knowledge to construct amazing connections.

# Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology

* Lateral thinking is the use of knowledge from adjacent domains, withered technology is old technology. Nintendo first started off by combining old technology using adjacent domain knowledge
  * In other words, Nintendo started off by making cheap, simple toys in ways no one else considered to do
* People tend to only think in a narrow domain, known as functional fixedness
* Nintendo succeeded because it paired up vertical and lateral thinkers together
* The most likely to succeed in 3M inventor awards are polymaths: super in-depth in one area but relatively broad everywhere else
* With increasing ambiguity in our careers and a lack of well-defined problems, the utility of T-shaped people will increase in the near future
* Studies on comic book creators found that certain individuals far surpassed teams because they had extraordinary breadth, not length of experience or interesting skills
  * Diverse individual > diverse teams > specialized teams > specialized individuas
* Many breadth individuals simply correspond to specialists to confirm/exchange ideas. Broad network as well (eg. Charles Darwin)

# Fooled by Expertise

* People that dig into certain ideas and refuse to let go despite contrary evidence are often wrong
* In the book _Superforecasters_, this same pattern repeated: best forecasters were those who knew little about everything and integrated together; worst were narrow people
* These superforecasters actively tried to limit confirmation bias and looked for evidence to falsify their claims and assertions

# Learning to Drop Your Familiar Tools

* Ex:// Challenger disaster. Engineers never asked whether the data that they have is the right data or if they could get more data
  * One problem was NASA's incredibly quantitative culture. Everything needed to be backed up by data. Engineers could only come up with qualitative data
* Many people become rigid under pressure and increasingly rely on tools that don't work
* Some of the most successful organizations are ones where there is no congruent culture, where no one methodology is considered supreme.
  * Introduce incongruence and introduce actions that goes against org culture. This helps people understand what actually works
  * Create circular hierarchies where people at the top get input from people at the bottom

# Deliberate Amateurs

* Ex:// gel electrophoresis, Southern blot, graphene and malaria medications all created by people that weren't specialized
* System is meant for specializers, not for breadth people
* Most successful networks allowed people to easily among teams, preventing silos
* Work that appeared to be connecting different knowledge networks are often not rewarded in the start but gain massive appeal in the scientific community
* We need to build systems where range and breadth are important aspects

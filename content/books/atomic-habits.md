# **Introduction**

* Backbone of the book; cue, craving, response, reward
# **The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make Big Differences**

## The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

* Ex: Brailsford and British cycling team. He had a philosophy called aggregation of marginal gains: if you were to improve each part of cycling by 1%, output is a significant increase.
  * Found areas to improve cycline team performance: bike, clothes, massage,
  * Britain did amazing after these small changes.
* We often overestimate importance of defining moments, but small incremental gains can lead to huge success (think of exponential growth). Habits are those that enable these incremental gains
* Similarly, accumulation of tiny losses and error can lead to huge problems later on
* Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformation
* This is the reason why you should be more concerned over your trajectory vs your current results, because trajectory can influence a lot. Outcomes are lagging measures of habits
* Beware of compounding effects of everything
* Breakthrough moments are also a product of many previous actions that are built through habits. Think of it like a crictical threshold
  * This is one of the reasons why building habits that last is so hard: changes dont come fast enough for human brain to notice. You may be stuck in the platea u of latent potential but you will break out
* Start focusing on the systems you are using to reach your goal
* Problems arise when we dont think enough about the systems that we are using to reach your goal
  * **Winners and losers have the same goals**: remember that success has survivorship bias - we dont get to hear about losers who had the same goals as winners.
  * **Achieving a goal is only a momentary change**: to solve problems for good, you need an air tight system
  * **Goals restrict happiness:** happinness becomes tied to goals, which are rare to achieve anyways
  * **Goals are at odds with long-term progress:** if you only maintin your system to get a goal, then you will be back at square one after the goal has passed
* You do not rise to level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems
* Atomic habit: a tiny change or incremental improevement
## How Your Habits Shape your Identity and Vice Versa

* Changing our habits is challenging because either we try to change the wrong thing or we try to change the habit in the wrong way
* Changing the wrong thing:
  * 3 layers of behaviour change: first layer is changing outcomes (goals usually about this first layer), second layer is change your process (habits), third layers is changing identity
  * Many people only focus on the outer most layer, but instead, try to change your whole identity to focus on who we want to become
  * Behind every set of actions is a set of beliefs, so spend your time trying to change the beliefs as well
* Ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. The more pride you have in taht aspect of identity, the more motivate you willbe to mainatin habits associated with it
* The more deeply a thought/action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it
* By repeatedly doing something that conforms to the identity you want to become, you WILL morph into it. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
* Very simple way of changing your identity:
  * Decide the type of person you want to be
  * Prove it to yourself with small wins
* Remember, habits simply help you becomethe type of person you wish to be. That is the most important question

## How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

* Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience that you had learned as you came to associate a particular reward with a particular action and cue
* Our brain makes habits so that we dont have to deal with it conciously
* 4 parts of the habit loop:
  * **Cue:** triggers to intiatie a behaviour
  * **Cravings:** motivational force behind every habit. You crave the change in state the action provides
  * **Response:** actual habit you perform. This depends on how motivate you are and how much friction is associated with the behaviour. Also depends on ability
  * **Reward:** they satisfy cravings, especially immediate ones. They also teach us which actions are worth
* If any behaviour is insufficient and any of these 4 stages, habits will not be formed.
  * Eliminate the cue, reduce the craving, make the behavior difficult, reward fails the desire
  * Without the first three, the behaviour will not occur. If the fourth one removed, the behaviour will never be repeated
* The cue and craving make up the problem phase, which is when you realize something needs to change
* The response and reward are the solution phase where you provide solution to the problem
* Four Laws of Behaviour Change;
  * To create a good habit, make the cue obvious. To break a  bad habit, make it invisible
  * To create a good habit, make the craving attractive. To break a bad one, make it unattractive
  * To create a good habit, make the response easy. To break a bad one, make it difficult
  * To create a good habit, make the reward satisfying. To break a bad one, make it unsatsifying

# **The First Law: Make it Obvious**

## The Man Who Didn’t Look Right

* Daughter in law able to identify that father in law is going to have a  heart attack by looking at him, Gulf War soldier could immedietely tell that a missile is striking, musueum curators can tell between authentic and fakes.
* Brain constantly picking up on cues that is useful in predicting certain outcomes. Sometimes, you are not even aware of the cue.
* Until you make the unconcious concious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate" - Carl Jung
  * Ex: Japanese train conductors use pointing-and-calling to always comment on any details. This forces any cues to come to the concious so that they can report dangerous situations
* Implement a similar point and call system in your life to identify habits tht are positive and negative. How do you know if a habit is good or bad? Remember: “Does this behaviour help me become the type of person I would like to be?”
* Say it out loud as  well. All of this should help you identify your cues and habits and raise it form your unconcious

## The Best Way to Start a New Habit

* Implementation intention: a plan you make beforehand about when and where you will implement a particular habit
  * Format: When situation X arises, I will perform response Y
  * Ex: writing down when and where you will exercise, writing down exact time you will get flu shot
* People how make a specific plan for when and where they will peform a new habit are more likely to follow through
* If you arent sure when to start a habit, try first day of week/month/year because hope is usually higher
* Helps to say no to things that would derail habit formation
* Diderot Effect: obtaining a new posession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases
  * Many human behaviours follow this: you decide what to do next based on what you have just finished
* Can use this to your advantage by linking your new habit with an old habit: after \[CURRENT HABIT], I will \[NEW HABIT]
* The secret to creating a good habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off
* Choose a time/place whn you’re likely to be sucessful at forming the habit
* The cue should have the same frequency as your desired habit, highly specific and immedietely actionable

## Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

* Certain behaviours tend to arise in certain environments: moving water near drink stations increased water sales, cookies on kitchen table --> people will eat, whispering in church, etc.
* Environment can be and should be architected in a way that is most conducive to habit formation
  * Ex: Dutch electricity meters in main hallway reduced electricity usage, fly stickers in Schipol urinals
* Essentially, environment should make the cues obvious and should contain multiple triggers
* Same principle applies to negative habits: design environment so that negative cues are not obvious
* Habits are also linked with context: for one person, the couch is where she reads books, while for another person, it could be where you eat and watch TV
* Easier to create new habits in a new environment/rearrange your current environment
* Avoid mixing the context of one habit with another.
  * Ex: phone for messaging, computer for work, tablet for reading, etc..
* If you want stable and predictable behaviours, you need to have a stable and predictable environment

## The Secret to Self-Control

* Ex: American soldiers in Vietnam were highly addicted to heroin, but when they came back to the states, that addiction was remove almost overnight
  * Reason: extreme environment change which left it devoid of the various cues taht led to heroin addiction
  * Compare to modern day drug users: they get addicted at home, get clean at the hospital, and then come back to the same context where they got addicted
* People with high self-control are better at structing lives such that willpower and self-control are paradoxically not required! They spend less time in tempting scenarios
  * Ones who need to use self-control the least are the ones most in control
* Don’t try to become a more disciplined person; try to create a more disciplined environment
* Cue-induced wanting: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit —> a bad spiral
* You can breaka a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it
* Resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. People can’t upkeep positive habits in a negative enviroment
* One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it

# **The Second Law: Make It Attractive**

## How to Make a Habit Irresistible

* Supernormal stimuli: heightened version of reality that elicits a stronger response(three red dots on beak created frenzied pecking, big round ball meant goose waddled faster to retrived)
  * Human example: junk food. All the important stuff that ancestors needed like salt and fat is all in junk food. When we consume it, it is a greater than normal stimuli so we become addicted and start to overeat. Start of a bad habit
* Supernormal stimuli is a great example of the dangers of the second law of habits
* Dopamine is iis intrinsically linked with habits. It is released when you are experiencing pleasure as well as anticipation
* Much more of our brain neural circuitry is devoted to the wanting of things then the liking of things
* Temptation bundling: link an action you want to do with an action you need to do
  * Ex: linking Netflix with exercise, ABC putting shows on Thursday and linking with relaxation
* Uses Premack’s Principle: more proabable behaviours will reinforce less probable behaviors
* You can combine habit stacking with temptation bundling but putting the habit that you want after the habit you need

## Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

* Normal habits in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you will find
  * Ex: Polgar sisters loved chess because it was so normalized in their lifestyle
* Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in. We like to imitate the close, the many and the powerful
* Imitating the close:
  * The closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits
  * Join a culture where your desired behaviori is the normal behavior and you share something with the group
* Imitating the many:
  * We like to look at the group to guide our behavior, especially if the group is big
  * Downside: normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of the individual
  * Changing your habits against the grain of the group is not very attractive
* Imitating the powerful:
  * Since humans value power, prestige and status, we tend to follow the habits of those that are highly successful
  * If a behavior can get us approval, respect and praise, we find it attractive
  * We are constantly asking “what will others think of me” and change our habits so that we conform

## How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits

* Your habits are simply solutions to solve deeper, base motives. We need to understand that current habits may not be the best way to solve the problem you are facting
* If you can associate a solution with the problem, you keep coming back to it. Predicting whether a certain action will solve a problem is what our brains do constantly
* Predicting that you would be better off pusuing a particular solution creates the craving need for us to act.
* Your cravings are simply ways to address your underlying motives. If the habit is successful at addressing the motive, then we repeat it and start to develop a craving
* We can make hard habits more attractive if you can associate them with a positive experience
* Reframing habits to highlight benefits rather than drawbacks makes habits seem a lot more attractive
* Can create a motivation ritual by associating habit with something you enjoy immedietely before it
# **The Third Law: Make It Easy**

## Walk Slowly, But Never Backward

* We often get bogged down by creating the perfect plan to start a habit, but often we just need to begin
* There’s a difference in being in motion and taking action: in motion, you're planning and learning; in action, you’re actually working to deliver an oucome
* Motion feels like you’re getting things done, but you want to be practicing and getting int action
* The key is repetition, not perfection in your habits
* Our brain uses repetition to change itself to become better at a new habit. Difficulty vanishes once the grey matter networks are in place, but that requires significant usage over time
* Must practice a habit a lot to make it automatic. Not about time, but how often you practice

## The Law of Least Effort

* When deciding between two similar options, people gravitate to the option that requires the least amount of work
* Most habits that we do don’t require huge amounts of motivation, so make your habits as easy to follow
* To make habits easier to follow, use environment design (eg. make the gym on the way back from work a part of your commute)
* Addition by subtraction: find all pain points and remove them (eg. Japanese firms and lean production model)
* You can prime your environment by setting it up to make it conducive to your habit
* You can invert this same principle to make bad habits really difficult (eg. remove batteries from TV remote so it takes longer to turn on TV)

## How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two Minute Rule

* In our days, we have decisive moments that change how we behave for the the rest of the day
* These decisive moments set the option avaliable to our future self. Thus, essential to master these decisive moments
* Two-Minute Rule: When you start a new habitm it should take less than two minutes to do
* Establish the habit before you start to improve on it. Make it become a ritual
* Always stay below the point where the habit feels like a chore
* Habit shaping: focus on the first two minutes of another intermediate step and build up to a good habit

## How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

* Commitment device: a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future
  * Ex: Victor Hugo and removing all clothes from his room tp write Hunchback of Notre Dame
* Create your habits ina way that makes it harder to get out of
* Make your bad habits impractical to do
* Some actions are onetime choices that keep paying over and over again. Focus on that!
* Use your technology to make the good habits easy to do and automate them

# **The Fourth Law: Make It Satisfying**

## The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change

* Ex: team instituted Safeguard in Karachi houses, which were considered extermely pleasurable and effective handwashing quickly became a force of habit
* Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remember and repeating
* Cardinal rule: what is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided
* Human brain is living in an immediate return enviornment, but reality is a delayed-return environment, leading to time inconsistency where we value the present more than the future
* This is why many of us engage in bad habits: rewards are immediate but consequences are long-term
* As a general rule: the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more you should question if it aligns with your long-term goals
* This leads to a general rule of success: those who succeed are those that can withstand delayed gratification
* For a habit to stick, you need to feel successful. A good technique is reinforcement, where you make the end of the habit satisfying
* Use visible rewards that are in line with the identifty you want to pursue (eg. don’t use icecream as the reward for working out)
* Eventually, the new identity is enough of a reward that you won’t need the initial reward

## How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

* Ex: Trent Dyrsmid paper clip rule that made him an extraordinary salesman
* Habit tracker: have a calendar/tracker to keep a streak.
  * Obvious: keeping up the streak can become part of the trigger for the habit
  * Attractive: we become motivated by seeing our own progress
  * Satisfying: it’s satisfying to cross an X on the calendar and see progress
* Tracking and measuring is hard, but has lots of upside.
* Measurement should be automated and the measurements can be checked less regularly
* Manual tracking should be limite dto most important habit
* Use habit stacking to track as soon as you completed habity
* It is inevitable that habit breaks down: remind yourself that you will have to start over streak, but you won’t miss two days in a row
* Never put up a zero because you lose out on the gains of compounding
* Goodhart’s law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
  * This is because we start to optimize for that measure, and not the behaviour
* Don’t only use numbers for measurement

## How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

* Ex: Fisher proposal to kill the person that carries the nuclear bomb laucnhc codes to the president is an immediate inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change
* We are more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is not satisfying, especially if the pain is immediate
* The strength of the punishment should match the strength of the behavior
* Habit contract: a verbal/written agreement to state commitment to a particular habit with one/two people to act as accountability partners and sign off on the contract
* Knowing that someone is watching your progress is a great motivator. In fact, their thoughts about us if we don't fulfill the habit is  a powerful social cost

# **Advanced Tactics**

## The Truth About Talent

* The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition
* Habits are easier to perform and more satisfying to stcik if they align with natural abilities
* Recognize that people are born with different abilities due to genes
* Genes do not determine destiny, but the determine your areas of opportunity
* Because of genetic predispositions, it makes sense the choose habits that best suit you
* If you end up in the right area, you will become better and better because you enjoy it and you become a maestro. It is a virtuous cycle
* Explore/exploit trade off: exploit something as it continue to give benefits, and explore if you can exploit something more. Greedy approach to opportunities
  * How do you know if you have reached a good opportunity? Ask the following
    * What feels like fun to me, but work to others?
    * What makes me lose track of time?
    * Where do I get greater retun than the average person
    * What comes naturally to me?
* If you can’t win by finding an area where you are good at, then make your own area/be different
  * Combine your skiils, making it easier to stand out
  * You can often be the best if you specialize in a narrow category
* Our genes clarify what we need to work on and what to work hard on

## The Goldlilocks Rule: How To Stay Motivated in Life and Work

* The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. This is known as the Goldilocks Rule
* Once a habit ha been established, continue to advance in small ways to keep engaged. You can achieve flow state
  * Should be roughly 4% beyond current ability
* Best athletes are those that can deal with boredom of practice. The greatest threat to success is not failure, but boredome
* This is why habit-forming products incorporate variable reward, so there is continuous novelty
* Variable reward doesn’t create new cravings, but it does amplify
* Continue to work on challenges of just manageable difficulties to keep things interesting
* Don’t be a fair weather athelete: keep to your habit regardless of what its going on in life
* Fall in love with the boredom

## The Downside of Creating Good Habits

* Habits ease up on our brain and we have more mental space to do other things
* Problem with good habits is that you don’t respond to feedback anymore on those habits. It becomes too automatic
* Mastery = habits + deliberate practice
  * All about focusing on tiny element of succes, internalizing skills, and using new habit to move on
* Need to be able to monitor habits and progress so that you can continually move on
  * Ex: Lakers and CBE score. Needed to improve by 1% every game, which made them NBA champs
  * Keep a journal/notepad where you continually reflect and improve
  * Try to reflect periodically
* Big downside: deired identity creates pride that covers up your weak spots
  * Solution: don’t let a single belief define you. Don’t cling too much on your identity

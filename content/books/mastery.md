# Introduction

## The Ultimate Power

* We have all felt a feeling when a looming crisis or deadline approaches and suddenly creative overdrive kicks in with increased focus
  * This sensation is mastery, and it can be manufactured! It is not innate, but built
* Mastery has three phases: apprenticeship -> creative-active -> master
  * Apprentice: more of an outsider and trying to learn as much as we can, but very limited in what we can actually do
  * Creative-active: we have an inside and comprehensive knowledge of how things work and can start experimenting
  * Master: have a complete understanding and can manufacture work that is deeply impactful. Intuition is basically controlled
* Everyone's brain has the capability of producing mastery, it just needs to be trained. It is not  something given to privileged people

## The Evolution of Mastery

* Humans became masters of the earth because of:
  * Powerful visual systems which enabled focus and protected us
  * A reasoning brain that could override instinct
  * Social intelligence
* We also have a special ability to think inside of something else, so we can anticipate actions. This is what led to mastery in early humans
* This changed our relationship with time, as it no longer became an enemy but a friend. The longer we observed, focused and practiced, the more likely we were to succeed
  * This fundamental human trait is slowly disappearing in a distracted world

## Keys to Mastery

* If we all have a brain built for mastery, then why is it that so few are able to attain it?
* Ex:// Darwin and his younger cousin Galton
  * Galton was the smarter of the two but never achieved mastery in any field
  * Darwin happened to follow the track of mastery by finding an outlet for his childhood passion of collecting specimens via the HMS Beagle, then apprenticed and finally started to develop his theory of evolution
  * He worked harder and faster than Galton and this process only happened because of a childhood inclination towards a subject
* Everyone has some sort of unique inclination, but the majority never act too much on it
  * Masters that we know tend to have a deep and clear calling which they dedicate all their effort towards -> can withstand all the pain of the process to become a master
* In the past, there wasn't much career choice, so mastery was a coincidence, hence why there are so few masters
* The issue in our modern world is that mastery has been denigrated
  * Passivity has become a moral stance now. People believe that mastery and power are evil and are skills of the "oppressive hierarchies"
  * If you listen to those around you, you might lose out on your creative potential and the lack of motivation will catch up to you
* Couple keys to mastery:
  * Attempting to become a master is necessary and positive: it is important to solve the world's problems
  * The mind and quality of brain that you deserve depends on the actions you take, not on genetics

# Discovery Your Calling: The Life's Task

## The Hidden Force

* Talked about the life of Leonardo da Vinci
  * Was an illegitimate son of a noble and had very little opportunities for education
  * In his childhood, he used to do a lot of drawings from nature -> became apprenticed as an artist
  * His art was different because he was very rigorous about his work (naturally which took more time) and applied scientific principles
  * After Lorenzo d'Medici snubbed him for a commission, Leonardo decided to follow his guts and delve in all sorts of subjects (eg. engineering, metallurgy, biology) and became an advisor rather than a someone benefitting from patronage
  * "Just as a well-filled day brings a blessed sleep, so too shall a well-filled life bring a blessed death" - Leonardo da Vinci

## Keys to Mastery

* Many masters have confessed an inner force that moves them to do certain things
  * This particularly manifests during childhood, where we don't care as much about society
  * Masters feel this force so strongly they think of it as an inner spirit
* The counterforce is societal force which pushes you to do tasks that are more prestigous or pays more
* The problem is that counterforce usually overrides the inner force and you tend to hate your career and fall behind. This should be avoided at all costs
* Three stages to realizing your Life Task:
  * First stage: reconnect with your instincts and uniquness
  * Second stage: Reflect on your career path and continue or redirect
    * Your work shouldn't be supporting your happinness for things outside of work. It should be the source of happiness! It should be a vocation rather than work
  * Third stage: start with a generous home base and begin your journey, experimenting to find your groove
* Eventually you will hit upon a niche and you can then move out on your own and become your own master
  * It will feel like childlike joy and wonder
  * Your creative skills will come at a premium and you can choose which problems you want to work on
* What we lack most in our world is a sense of purpose. Starting the journey will pay off huge dividends
* If you allow yourself to learn more about yourself, you will become a master

## Strategies for Finding Your Life's Task

### Return to your origins - the primal inclination strategy

* Examples:
  * Albert Einstein was first fascinated with compasses and magnets -> evolved into love for hidden forces and fields
  * Marie Curie was first fascinated by father's physics and chemistry experiments -> evolved into interest of chemistry
  * Ingmar Bergman was obsessesed over a cinematograph as a child -> became a renowned director
  * Martha Graham witnessed the power of dance in overcoming her issues of conveying her emotions -> became a master dancer
  * Daniel Everett was immersed in Mexican culture and realized love for other cultures -> became a world-renowned anthropologist
  * John Coltrane witnessed power of saxophone music -> became a world-renowned jazz artist
* Look at the activities that you enjoyed as a kid which were uncorrupted by parents
  * What did you love to repeat? What subjects did you have an unusual curiosity?

### Occupy the perfect niche - the Darwinian strategy

* V.S. Ramachandran example: loved collecting things as a child and enjoyed esoteric research -> became a doctor -> started really specific research on phantom limbs and other anomolous neurological disorders
* Yoky Matsuoka example: loved tennis, math & physics at an early age and wanted to create tennis robots -> fell into robotics and pursued at Berkeley and MIT -> studied neuroscience -> became even more specialized and started field of neurobotics
* Career world is like an ecological system: the more people in a particular role/space, the harder it is to thrive (have to politick, can't really spend time to be a master)
* A better career strategy is to become very specialized in your career in two different ways:
  * Ramachandran strategy: start off with a general field and find specializations that are interesting to the point where you are the sole master of your niche
  * Matsuoka strategy: combine many different fields and create an entirely new and unoccupied niche
  * Requires patience, but it leads to freedom to roam and pursue whatever you think is right to pursue

### Avoid the false path - the rebellion strategy

* Mozart example: father forced him to do court music which he despised. He rebelled and started to compose for operas, which is what he became famous for
  * He recognized that composing is his forte and he wanted to develop this skill
* If you choose the career for the wrong reason (eg. prestige, money, owing to parents), you will feel unfulfilled and your work suffers. The attention that you got as a young one gradually wanes because you are not motivated to become the top of the top
* Recognize that you are following the wrong path and actively rebel against the forces that have forced you to go asunder in your path

### Let go of the past - the adaptation strategy

* Freddie Roach example: Freddie didn't like boxing a lot as a child but some snarky comments from his mom gave him the motivation. He soon retired because he was losing, but then got into the career of coaching and became an all-star boxing coach using new techniques
* Don't be stagnant or loyal to a particular career or company. Your Life Task can change and you should be willing to adapt
* You shouldn't look with remorse when things try to change. Move on, be fluid and see if you can use your past in your new Life Task

### Find your way back - the life-or-death strategy

* Buckminister Fuller example: was a great inventor in his childhood -> lost his way in adulthood and started a failed construction business -> about to commit suicide but chose to continue -> became a master & innovative architect
* Takes a lot of work to come back from a failed path onto the Life Task, but it is fully worth

## Reversal

* Some people are faced with their limitations and never feel a calling. People surrounding them will tell them they have no purpose and if not careful, this can become a self-fulfilling prophecy
* Temple Grandin example: born with autism and faced a huge amount of challenge. Had a gift with empathizing with animals. Went to university -> learned some engineering -> made a career out of building ranch machines that were efficient and humane to animals. Now a prof
* Ignore your weaknesses and focus on your simple strengths without thinking too much about the future to re-establish confidence. Remove the desire to be like others
  * Don't feel concerned about those who are naturally smart. It's often a curse because they don't learn about the power of diligence and focus

# Submit to Reality: The Ideal Apprenticeship

## The First Transformation

* Darwin example:
  * Darwin hated school. His father pushed him to do medicine and become a clergyman, but he loved the outdoors and collect specimens
  * His professor friend from Cambridge recommended him to the HMS Beagle as a naturalist. While not a seafaring person, he found peace observing everyone on board, just like how he did as a child
  * He arrived in South America and found a lot of diversity. He became more adventurous and was able to focus for far longer and was much more satisfied
  * Came to Galapagos Islands and learned about the species there -> started developing theory of evolution. His Life Task was to prove the theory

## Keys to Mastery

* All the masters that we admired spend a considerable amount of time (5-10 years) developing their craft
  * This stage often doesn't get the credit it deserves because there are no big outcomes, but it is hugely important in the development of the master
* In our childhood, we are put in dependency mode and taught from teachers and books. This doesn't work in real life and the naivety is not rewarded. Apprenticeship trains us in the real world
* Everyone's path of apprenticeship is different, but it is important to save ourselves from committing huge mistakes during this time
* The goal of apprenticeship is to transform yourself, not to gain more money and fame
  * By the end, you should be able to remain disciplined, focused and detached. You should be able to handle the complexities of your role
  * This means that wherever you perform your apprenticeship should offer the most room for growth. Pay shouldn't be the biggest factor, because that can come later
  * Take the apprenticeship to really challenge yourself in order to transform and reconnect everything back to your Life Task

## The Apprenticeship Phase - Three Steps

* Note that the following steps do not need to be done all in one place. Some of it can span multiple companies, some people choose to do this during school and work, etc.
* Place different weights on each step depending on your career

### Step One: Deep Observation - The Passive Mode

* Every career has its own environment, rules of engagement and social atmosphere. Your first step is to understand the reality as deeply as possible through observation
* The greatest mistake you can make is trying to impress others. You should submit to reality. If people are impressed by you, it should be because of your seriousness in learning
* Two things to observe closely:
  * What are the rules and patterns that represent success? Look at those succeeding and failing to get an idea
  * Understand the power dynamics. Your job is not to moralize but just observe. When you are a master, you can change this as necessary
* This great observation is what enabled Darwin to do so well in his voyage despite being in completely different cultures at home (seafaring culture, gaucho culture). This permeated in his work, because he observed and thought deeply before acting
* A few important outcomes of this:
  * Helps you navigate and avoid costly mistakes
  * Observing unfamiliar environments is a life-long skill
  * Develop your skill in human psychology and ability to focus
  * Accustom to habit of observe -> analyze -> act. This is important as you become a master

### Step Two: Skills Acquisition - The Practice Mode

* Start to determine what skills are truly needed and reduce them to a set of practicible skills
* You need to practice and repeat A LOT. You need to immerse yourself in an environment where you can practice and repeat
* You want to lead to a cycle of accelerated returns: practice -> get better at practice -> do it faster and have opportunities to do more interesting practice -> spend even more time practicing -> getting even better, faster
* Principles about skills:
  * Learn one skill at a time to develop focus
  * This process might be tedious, but it is essential to NOT short-circuit and get distracted. Embrace the boredom; it will pay off in it's dividends. You want to be so good that it becomes automatic to practice this skill
  * Once the skill is practiced enough, self-critique and get feedback from others
* This will take a lot of time (\~10k hours), despite the field you are in

### Step Three: Experimentation - The Active Mode

* Start doing small projects and expose yourself to criticism. You generally want to do this before you are actually ready so that you can maximize growth
* Once you feel that you have learned as much as you could, go to another place and repeat or declare your independence

### Summary

* People believe that the computer age has made the craftsmen model obsolete, but that is very dangerous. It's not that technology has made everything easier, but everything has become far more complex and globalized
* The future belongs to those who can learn the fastest and can organize information the best. The way of developing skills has not changed
  * There will be conflict in the future between those who focused and those who didn't, those who learned and those who didn't
* Don't look down upon those who work with their hands; in fact, this mindset of being a builder is important to becoming a master. You need to transform through apprenticeship to become a competent builder

## Strategies for Completing the Ideal Apprenticeship

### Value learning over money

* Benjamin Franklin example: Franklin had the opportunity to run a lucrative candle-making business from his dad, but decided to pursue harder and less lucrative printing business. He did it because he wanted to become better at writing
* Albert Einstein example: he had the opportunity to go to a well-paying dynamo and insurance business, but he didn't want to because it would not give him enough time to do his physics thought experiments. He instead worked at the patent office, which he figured would help him understand various aspects of science and help him become a better reasoner
* Martha Graham example: did dancing at a commercial company but hated that it sapped her of her creative energy. She instead did teaching and survived on bare minimum and worked on her craft on her own time
* Freddie Roach example: basically started coaching for free, but it would take up loads of his time (along with his telemarketing job). He withstood the challenge and started his own business later
* Beware of chasing money in your apprenticeships, because if you don't learn valuable skills, that will catch up to you and you will fall
* Value learning above alll else where you get the chance to do hands-on work
* Money will come to you when you are a master

### Keep expanding your horizons

* Zora Neale Hurston example: Zora was born and brought up in a black-led town in the South and learned a lot about stories. She read a lot in her childhood. Due to familial problems, Zora was unable to continue education
  * She had to work menial jobs (cleaning, manicurist) but she developed her own self-directed apprenticeship by reading and listening to conversations during her work. She didn't let her status or hardships limit her horizons
  * She worked extremely hard and passed high school & entered Howard University. Wrote a successful short story -> moved to New York to write -> did more education at Barnard -> wrote several successful novels
* What we need to learn from Zora is that our access to knowledge is usually dependent on status, but if we internalize our status that we have at the very beginning we will never grow
* Whenever you learn, go above and beyond and try to your best to improve
* Be careful on who you would want in your vicinity: you want your circle to challenge you and help you grow

### Revert to a feeling of inferiority
* Daniel Everett example: was a Christian missionary who was assigned to a Mayan village that spoke a very tough language
  * He realized that the only way to really learn the language was to become like a child and throw away the Western superiority complex
* What prevents a lot of people from growing is increasig smugness and arrogance as we grow older, which is a learning diability
* As an apprentice, your goal should be to be as meek and dependent as possible on others in order to open your mind to learning
  * This is temporary and you will soon be independent in a few years, but being childishly inferior and wondrous will help massively in learning

### Trust the process
* Cesar Rodriguez example: he accidentally ended up in fighter jet school but soon came to love it. However well he did in simulators, he always had a fear in the cockpit
  * To combat this, he trained extremely hard, much more than the 'golden boys' of his class. He eventually got good enough to the point where the plane felt like an extension of himself
  * He's now a fighter jet ace
* Many people will reach a point of frustration, panic and fear in their apprenticeship. The key is to keep moving
  * Remember that time is the magic ingredient when it comes to mastering skill. By trusting in compounding and consistency, you will eventually overcome any humps in your apprenticeship journey

### Move toward resistance and pain
* Bill Bradley example: Bradley loved basketball but he had no real natural talent despite height for the sport. He decided to create an extremely rigorous training programme to force himself to become a basketball star
  * He practiced 3 hours every day after school and 8 hours on weekends. He made the training even harder by impairing his vision, forcing himself to use peripheral vision, and more
  * Even when his family went on vacation, he found spots to continue his basketball practice and continuously upped the challenge
  * Through all of his hard work, he managed to become an All-Star basketball player renowned for his dribbling and passing
* John Keats example: Keats did a rigorous self-apprenticeship to learn all things poetry. He usually imitate other famous poems and spun it in order to train himself
  * His final test was a brutal poem about a Greek myth, 4,000 lines long. He struggled through it but finished and learned invaluable lessons that made him a star poet
* Usually, we try to avoid the hard parts and overtrain on the easy skills. This is not the way of the master
* The master goes down the resistance part: you resist the temptation of being nice to yourself and you resist being distracted. 5 hours of focused work will be 10 hours for others

### Appprentice yourself in failure
* Henry Ford example: Ford failed twice before he made the Model A. Everytime he failed, he analyzed his mistakes and did a root cause analysis to prevent from happening again
* For entrepreneurial ideas, failues & mistakes (if used wisely) are the best ways of educating yourself on your own incompetencies
  * You can't wait for your ideas to happen. You need to execute on it fast to get the best feedback from your mistakes

### Combine the "how" and the "what"
* Santiago Calatrava example: Calatrava was a gifted artist but soon gained a huge interest in architecture
  * As he was studying in architecture school, he realized that he didn't have a good understanding of how architecture was implemented, so he started over again in civil engineering
  * After 14 years in university, he finally entered work world where he create incredible structures that seemed to move but were structurally sound
* In your apprenticeships, try your best to understand how everything works. It gives you a huge leg up over those who only understand what things do

### Advance through trial and error
* Paul Graham example: was a hacker in high school -> did CS at Cornell -> CS at Harvard (but hated academia) -> art at RISD -> consulting -> making own company -> YC
  * His life was full of trial and error and eventually converged on what he truly enjoyed doing
* This hacker model of trial and error may be the modern day equivalent of apprenticeships: use the Internet to learn as much skills as possible to help you in your deepest interest. Use trial and error methodologies to converge on a type of work that you really enjoy
* At the end, you will have a wide range of skills and you will be ready to make great use of various opportunities that come your way because only you have the unique pairing of skills

## Reversal
* There's no shortcuts; the Apprenticeship phase is mandatory part of becoming a master

# Absorb the Master's Power: The Mentor Dynamic

## The Alchemy of Knowledge
* Faraday example:
  * Faraday was from a poor family, but his reverance for books enabled him to become an apprentice book-binder, where he learned about the newest topics in the world, especially electricity
  * To overcome his lack of university credentials, Faraday did his own apprenticeship by recreating experiments, attending public lectures and reworking his lecture notes, which the Royal Society president took note
  * When Humphrey Davy needed a note-taker assistant, Faraday was recommended. After the temporary gig, Faraday was asked to be his laboratory assistant, which is the ultimate form of mentorship since Davy was an expert in chemistry and growing his knowledge in electricity
  * Faraday grew a lot underneath Davy, but as the years went by, Davy started to hold Faraday back. 
  * Faraday outdid Davy by creating a brilliant experiment to show the conical relationship of magnetic fields and electric currents. Davy tried to take credit, but Faraday's work was very clear. Soon Faraday overtook Davy

## Keys to Mastery
* Due to increasing democratization, humans are finding it harder to accept that there are Masters among us that are worth learning from
  * We praise those who find faults in these masters and we become increasingly skeptical, likely because of our unconcious ego
* All that you should really care about in the early stages of your career should be learning the most important skills in the most effective way possible
  * During the Apprenticeship phase, you will need mentors who guide you, since that is the most effective way to kickstart your own learning. This is not an indictment on you; it just simply means you have a temporary weakness that a master can help overcome
* Mentorship is simply far more effective as a method of learning compared to self-learning, because they can streamline your curriculum and provide real-time feedback. This enables us to utilize our most creative years most effectively
* A really strong 2-way mentor-protege relationship is incredibly powerful, because the protege admires and soaks up far more, and the mentor is emotionally invested, divesting more secrets
* You will need to use a Master's self-interest in order to access them, just like Faraday used Davy's need for organization to gain access to him
* Work on yourself to become an organized and focused machine -> the right mentors will come your way when they hear of your hunger and ambition
* Don't feel afraid of approaching masters at any level; they are surprisingly open to mentor others
* The best mentors are those who have skills in wide areas and are not specialized because they can train you to think and connect with different areas of knowledge
* You want as much personal interaction with your mentor to pick up on unconcious techniques that make them effective in their work
* You can have multiple mentors or use mentors from history, but usually a singular, present mentor is best
* Be wary of mentors who become dependent on you and start to hinder your growth. As soon as that happens, it's important that you subvert the play and leave
* In various phases of life, you will have several mentors who you will add and cut with ease. Don't be ashamed of this, as this is the way of the world

## Strategies for Deepening the Mentor Relationship

### Choose the mentor according to your needs and inclinations
* Frank Lloyd Wright example: was an apprentice draftsmen at a prestigious Chicago architectural firm, but the firm was using outdated architectural practices and he felt his growth waning
  * Heard about Louis Sullivan who needed a draftsmen -> got the job (even though he burned bridges) and propelled himself under Sullivan. Got fired for moonlighting later, but by then he gotten everything he needed
* Carl Jung example: while he was successful experimental psychologist, he still was uneasy with the lack of rigor in psychology
  * Approached Sigmund Freud and discussed psychology with him and became his apprentice
  * Learned a lot and confirmed many of his theories, but left Freud due to his dictatorial tendencies
* V.S. Ramachandran example: was an apprentice of Richard Gregory, a foremost neurologist in the field of optics. Became his apprentice and learned his experimental style
* Yoky Matsuoka example: apprenticed under Rodney Brooks, a robotics professor at MIT. He gave her the space and courage to pioneer a new field of robotics
* Be very mindful when selecting your mentor. Your choice should strategically align with your Life Task and your idiosyncracies
  * While mentor-protege relationships are similar to father-child relationships, there's one major difference: you can choose your mentor, but you cannot choose your family. Choose wisely

### Gaze deep into the mentor's mirror
* Hakuin Zenji example: Hakuin was a Zen monk, but he found that Zen Buddhism in Japan was losing it's way (suffering wasn't emphasized enough)
  * Hakuin searched far and wide and eventually found a Zen Master, Shoju Rojin, who was known for creating suffering for his students, which Hakuin needed
  * He spent all of his time with Shoju and solved some of his koans, which in response Shoju praised and guided
  * Even thous Hakuin left a few months, Shoju was the only mentor Hakuin had, and that was enough for him to reform Japan's Zen Buddhism
* Our culture has lost reverance for suffering, and that prevents is from really developing, because we don't know exactly where we are faltering
* Mentors who are willing to give the sharpest dose of reality for their students are the best type of mentors

### Transfigure their ideas
* Glen Gould example: was a child piano prodigy and mentored under Alberto Guerrero who taught him particular piano tricks
  * Although Gould often scorned Guerrero's techniques, he used it as a consummate professional -> mimicked Guerrero really well
  * His mimicry plus his own distinct style made Gould an incredible piano master
* An issue that some people can face is that they are drowned out by their mentors. Gould tackled this problem by taking all of Guerrero's advice and slightly changing it to fit his own inclinations
* This should happen with all advice to the point where you can start to compete with your master
* "Poor is the apprentice who does not surpass his master" - Leonardo da Vinci
### Create a back-and-forth dynamic
* Freddie Roach example: Freddie realized that the old way of training boxers was quite static and trainers were more observing rather than interacting with the boxers
  * When Pacquiao reached out for training, Roach took him on with his distinctive interactive training style
  * As Pacquiao became better, they started to change their styles of fighting and coaching based on Pacquiao's response. Training became very dynamic
* Sometimes, mentorship relations will go flat. The best way to solve this is for the mentor to be more adaptive to your style
* This is not compatible with a combative learner. You must be willing to work hard and focus such that the mentor starts to trust you more and becomes willing to adapt their mentorship strategy
## Reversal
* Sometimes, you will not have a mentor because you just don't have anyone
* Thomas Edison example: he had to heavily rely on books and jobs to build up his experience in electricity
* You need to work extra hard and be willing to focus for extremely long with ample amount of practical experimentation
# See People As They Are: Social Intelligence

## Thinking Inside
* Benjamin Franklin faced social issues at his work and became a social rationalist
  * 1st example: at his brother's printing shop in Boston, he started writing pseudonymous letters which became hugely popular. When he told his brother, he became very angry and kicked him out
  * 2nd example: when he moved to Philadelphia, he was overwhlemed from the governor's enterprising attitude for printing presses and moved to London to secure supplies. He realized too late that the governor was a talker and had no money to give Franklin
  * 3rd example: when he worked in London as a printing shop worker and refused to chip in for the beer funds, he was harrased by his workers
* Franklin started to totally accept human nature and swore to always take a step back when interacting with people. He wanted to understand their motivations before doing anything to avoid the mistakes of the past
  * 1st example: when his former Philadelphia employer tried to take him back after the London debacle, Franklin guessed that the employer wanted to train other printing shop workers and get rid of Franklin. He outmanouevered him and started his own successful printing shop
  * 2nd example: when a powerful legislator became his enemy, Franklin cooly analyzed him and discovered his need for attention and love of rare books. He combined this to ask favors of the legislator, and he became friends
  * 3rd example: when sent to France to secure funds against the British, he adopted French lifestyle (to the disdain of Americans) in order to convince the king to send money

## Keys to Mastery
* Humans have advanced social tools in their brains to deduce motivations, but our long childhood that tints our lenses with emotions prevents us from making rational use of these tools
* This is dangerous in adulthood because we cannot read people very well and may land us in hot waters
* Developing social intelligence just means that we discard our naive perspectives and hone our natural observational and empathy skills
* Franklin realized that the only way to really be socially effective is to immerse your mind in other's worlds!
  * Once he figured this out, he actually was able to spend more time learning and working rather than worrying about social issues
* You need to come to a realization that you are dominated by a naive social perspective. From there, you should understand how you made social blunders or failed to saw red flags
  * Once you realize this, you will slowly realize that you were operating in the blind before, because you have no idea what the motivations of people are
* Rather than being cynical once you come to this realization, you need to accept it. Those who deny or hide their dark sides are the most dangerous people (a wolf in sheep's clothing)
* There's two forms of social intelligence: specific and general. Master both during apprenticeship phase
* By cultivating social intelligence, you can actually benefit your own work as you begin to develop patience and its easier to connect to other people's experiences
### Specific Knowledge - Reading People
* Pay close attention to body language & tone of voice and don't take what they're saying at face value
* Focus outward but don't try to intrepret others actions as an affront to you. Stay detached
* Stressful and emotional periods are usually when the masks are off. Also look at people's actions & decisions. Combining with nonverbal cues and a sense of detachment + practice, you will be skilled at reading people
* People who present fronts that are very friendly or funny often are trying to hide something of the opposite nature
* Don't pay too much weight on first impressions, because they are often not truthful. Instead, let time unveal their character
* Your goal is to understand people's thoughts, motivations characters and values. This will help you predict what others will do in certain situations
* Be Bayesian instead of frequentist in your approach, because people change and observations will differ as a result
### General Knowledge - The Seven Deadly Realities
* Humans tend to exhibit 7 issues. Some can hide these issues really well until it blows up and leaves you in surprise
* **Envy**: we try to dismiss it and minimize by telling ourselves that people got success because of connections or luck. Denying and repressing this -> seething envy
  * They will sabotage you if envy is super destructive. Beware those who are super friendly when you first meet
  * If this is a particular concern, don't appear too perfect and don't try to trigger insecurities
* **Conformism**: Many times as part of an organization, a team creates a conformist culture. Even though we say we celebrate diversity of thought and personality, it will hurt you if you start to display it too overtly especially if the team is strongly conformist
  * In your apprenticeship phase, there's no point in getting into trouble with culture if you can avoid it. Adhere as much as you can and as you become a master, you can create your own culture
* **Rigidity**: in complex and changing situations, humans like to stick to the old because of comfort. When novelty occurs, the old guard will try their best to stop it
  * For the highly creative, this can be bad because as you introduce novelty into an environment, people will become defensive. As an apprentice, just continue to show deference for order but cultivate that independent spirit
* **Self-obsessiveness**: people usually do things out of self-interest. There's nothing inherently wrong in this, but people try to hide this nonetheless
  * Appeal to self-interest if you need a favour or some help
* **Laziness**: many people want to take shortcuts and will take credit or force you to do work for them because they are inherently lazy and want to profit off other people's hard work
  * Make it harder for people to steal your credit (unless it's a master, because that is expected as an apprentice)
  * Show your work publicly so people know who is doing the work
  * Be wary of collaboration with others and look at their past work intensity
* **Flightiness**: what people say and do change in a mercurial fashion. You will waste valuable mental space trying to understand why they changed their opinion
  * Be prepared and become detached. To prevent something like this sabotaging your efforts, look at their actions and not their words
* **Passive aggression**: some people hate to be overtly aggressive and start to act aggressively in a passive manner (eg. showing up late to your projecs, offhand comments)
  * How to deal with this: call them out on it (often works, I can personally attest to this) but even better is to avoid these people like the plague
  * How to detect passive aggression? Again, look at their history and actions. If they are known to stir up drama, then it's best to avoid
  * They are masters at emotional battles, which is huge waste of your time and effort
## Strategies for Acquiring Social Intelligence

### Speak through your work
* Ignaz Semmelweis example: Ignaz figured out that pregnant women were dying in his hospital because doctors were not washing their hands and unintentionally spreading disease
  * The issue was that the head doctor was very conservative and saw Semmelweis as an upstart willing to overthrow medical orthodoxy
  * Semmelweis started lectures and research to spread his views, but after he lost his hospital job, he moved to Budapest and implemented his theories. It worked but he did it with such tyrannical ferocity that doctors began to despise him
  * He never published his work properly. He did write a book but it was poorly written and was more of a diatribe against conservative doctors. People didn't accept his theories (because he didn't prove it with research) and he died humiliated
* William Harvey example: Harvey was a well-known doctor but he didn't take to Galen's theory of blood where livers manufactured blood and it was sent slowly throughout the body
  * Harvey theorized that the heart was actually a pump and blood was being sent quickly throughout the body. However, to prove it would be death to a patient due to blood loss of opening up a chest to examine hearts
  * Harvey realized people wouldn't accept his new theories immediately, so he waited to publish and instead ammassed evidence and support from other doctors and from the court
  * When he did publish his polemic, he naturally faced some opposition but he always politely and privately refuted any arguments. He was one of the only scientists who managed to establish a theory during his lifetime
* Stories of both men usually revolve around the science, but it is clear that social agility played a huge role in their success. Harvey realized that a scientist must also act like a courtier and should be clear and thorough in their work
* By focusing on excellent and detail-oriented work, you can easily rise above the bickering and politics. Gracefully accepting feedback as well is a hallmark
### Craft the appropriate persona
* Teresita Fernandez example: Fernandez had a hard time fitting in during high school and saw herself as an observer of peopl
  * In university, she was attracted to metal sculpturing and made some terrific pieces. The art world soon put her in the centre of attention and attributed mystery to her, which worked out well. Fernandez accepted this typecast since it was beneficial to her and played along
  * However, conceptions about female artists often irritated her. She molded her personality to be the direct opposite (i.e. more organized, more authoritive), which left her observers in wonder
  * She played the artist courtier extremely well and people respect her as a conceptual artists versed in many different materials
* Fernandez realized that her personality was extremely important to her success, so she took charge of her personality to match her goals. People usually don't change their personalities, but Fernandez developed that skill
* When people start to attribute certain characteristics due to your appearance, you might internalize it and spend all your time worrying about it. Your protection for this is to conciously mold it to your benefit and stay one step ahead of the public
* Molding your personality is not psychotic or evil; everyone does it unintentionally. If you pay attention to this and play up your dynamism, flexibility and mysterious qualities in your personality, it will help you in various situations
### See yourself as others see you
* Temple Grandin example: Grandin had autism and found it very difficult to understand nonverbal cues from humans (hence why she was so successful with animals)
  * She thought she could get by with great quality of her work and she wouldn't need to deal with social intelligence. She was dead wrong
  * Grandin had the ability to view herself in third person and tried to replay all the events where she caused a mistake. She realized she was making people feel inferior with her intelligence. She was able to correct it pretty easily by involving people in decisions and stopping her blunt criticism of her peers
  * When she became famous and began to give talks, she got feedback that she sounded like a machine and wasn't personable. Rather than being offended by this, Grandin worked on her stage prescence and became a very entertaining, informative and engaging speaker
* We all have our social flaws but it can be difficult to correct because either people don't give us honest feedback and/or we're too insecure to look at our own social fails
* Look at past instances where we caused issues and dissect what we did to cause others to be hurt or annoyed and correct it slowly. We can begin to develop self-detachment and will help us correct our mistakes
### Suffer fools gladly
* Johann Wolfgang Goethe example: Goethe was asked to be an advisor to the duke of Weimar. He hated court life and inane conversations, but he played dumb and rarely ventured his opinions. Rather, he collected all the courtesans conversations and used it in his books
* Josef von Sternberg example: when creating a film with Emil Jannings (who seemed to be a huge pain), he would play tricks to get Jannings to do certain things in the film (which became one of Jannings' star performances) while also obliging Jannings' nonsensical requests
* Daniel Everett example: in his linguistic journey with the Piraha in Mexico, he realized that many of Noam Chomsky's theories of genetic origin of grammar was incorrect. Everett believed that culture had a more important relationship to grammar than previously thought
  * Many MIT linguists took issue with this and began to pepper him with emotional questions and caused a lot of havoc. Everett became quite emotional, but realized that he just needed to make his writings airtight to prevent criticism
* What should matter in your life is simple: long-term results and getting work done in an efficient and creative manner
  * Fools don't follow this and care more about the short-term: immediate money, attention, ego and looking good. There's too many fools to count (I 100% agree with this statement)
* We naturally combat fools by descending to their level and we lose sense of what is truly important in our lives
* There's no point in engaging with fools. It is simply human comedy. Just ignore and focus on your goals

## Reversal
* During his Harvard graduate years, Paul Graham started to really hate politics and social maneouvering. He deliberately picked positions or designed social structures to avoid this as much as possible (eg. YC is very non-bureaucratic)
* If you cannot tolerate social incompetency, then don't get involved and stay away. This generally will limit you from working in larger groups
* Generally speaking, it is wise to try to improve your social intelligence. This will spill into your personal life as well

# Awaken the Dimensional Mind: The Creative-Active

## The Second Transformation
* Mozart was languishing in his role as a court composer under the archbishop of Salzburg despite all the tours of Europe that he had done as a child
* He finally rebelled and stayed in Vienna, where he composed truly creative operas that incorporated several new musical processes
* His operas were incredibly popular and are still playing today
## Keys to Mastery
* Original mind: this was the mindset that we had as a child, where everything was new for us and it was easy to focus on different things. It was flexible and receptive to new ideas
* Conventional mind: our mind becomes constrained by words and concepts that we have previously encountered. Society is a big factor in this
* Masters retain the creativity of the original mind and add in the years of apprenticeships, knowledge and focus to develop some truly great work
  * Masters exhibit the dimensional mind: childlike creativity mixed with years of discipline
* Understand that each one of us has a creative spirit that wants to be exercised; our misery with our life is often due to the pressed nature of our creativity. It does entail risks, by merging creativity with experience is a recipe for fulfillment
* This is exactly what happened with Mozart: he repressed his creativity underneath the archbishop but finally rebelled and merged his creativity with his skill to create exquisite compositions
* The dimensional mind has two requirements: knowledge (from apprenticeships) and openness to try new things
  * We have to be careful that we don't let our knowledge confine our creativity
* There are three steps that one can take to unlock the dimensional mind as follows:
### Step One: The Creative Task
* Attacking a problem or task with creativity requires time, knowledge, emotional control and foresight. If you choose the wrong subject, then you will run out of energy
* The problem that you choose to tackle should come from deep within you (like Captain Ahab's obsession over Moby Dick) so that you can withstand the hours of drudgery and critics
* The choice of problem is what makes the Master! Edison, Proust and Rembrandt are just a few examples of individuals who didn't reach anywhere until they found a good outlet
* The primary law of the creative dynamic: your emotional commitment will translate directly to your work
* It's often wise to choose something that appeals to your and is slightly controversial, because it can feed off your latent rebellious feelings
* Two things to keep in mind:
  * The task must be realistic: you should have the ability to tackle it, but it shouldn't be easy; it should be ambitious but doable (provides more energy for you)
  * Let go of your need for comfort and security: creative tasks are always uncertain. If you keep latent ideas regarding security, you won't be able to set sail as you are tied to the shore
### Step Two: Creative Strategies
* The mind is a muscle that gradually tightens up because a) we only practice the same type of thought and b) focusing restricts our view
* The following strategies could be useful in counteracting the tightening
* **Cultivate negative capability**
  * John Keats writes that we need to be able to set aside our ego and just observe our work and the constant state of flux without putting any sort of judgement in order to be truly creative
  * Negative capability: the ability to endure and embrace mystery and uncertainty
  * Mozart entertained several different music styles, even with rival composers. Einstein contemplated his theories looking for dissenting facts
  * The need for certainty is the greatest disease for the creative mind
  * How to practice: conciously refrain from making opinions and seek uncertainty (eg. read books from different fields)
  * This shouldn't be the constant satte of mind, this should mainly be used for divergent thinking
* **Allow for serendipity**
  * We sometimes need a bit of chance to jog our creative brain. Focusing and shutting out everything is not always the right solution
  * First step: when doing research for your project, be as vast as possible and read more than necessary. This ensures that the brain can make connections between seemingly disparate information
  * Second step: allow for openness and loosening of spirit ocassionally to allow new ideas to germinate (eg. Einstein played the violin)
  * Ex: Louis Pasteur discovered inocculation by doing several different experiments and accidentally coming upon a weird result, which he then decided to pursue on a whim
  * Ex: Edison invented the phonograph by making the connection to telegraph machines and recording sound => completely random association made clear by playing and experimenting
  * Tip #1: keep a notebook to record serendipitous thoughts
  * Tip #2: think in terms of metaphors and analogies
* **Alternate the mind through "the current"**
  * The Current is a process of speculating and testing based on an observed phenomena
  * Ex: Darwin did this when doing 8 years of study on the barnacle
  * Many people tend to only speculate or they don't even chase the rabbit hole, which is a waste of an opportunity
  * Ex: Buckminister Fuller often created artifacts of his ideas to play around with and constantly improve based on public feedback
  * The artifact approach is really good for product development (whole Learn Startup method)
* **Alter your perspective**
  * Our minds tend to use mental shorthands to gloss over generalities for convenience. A creative mind is able to identify and subvert these shorthands. The following are a list of shorthands
  * _Looking at the what instead of the how_: if you face a problem, don't just classify. Think of how the problem occured to develop system thinking
  * _Rushing to generalities and avoiding details_: immersing yourself in the details will help prevent generalization, but make sure to always keep sight of the goal
  * _Confirming paradigms and ignoring anomalies_: anomalies often provide the richest source of information and should not just be explained away
  * _Fixating on what is present, ignoring what is absent_: many characters in history solved problems through via negativa. When we do this, we also want to reverse our emotional nature as well so that we remain cautious but bold
* **Revert to primal forms of intelligence**
  * Our ancestors were visual thinkers; words cannot describe everything we are thinking about
  * Many past figures used images, 3D models and other parts of their senses
#### Step Three: The Creative Breakthrough - Tension and Insight
* A lot of Masters often plod away at their work, lose their initial delight and start to feel tension and a little blocked. How do they solve it? They take a break and the solution "comes to them"
  * Albert Einstein came to some of his famous conclusions by just sleeping earlier
  * Wagner overcame his blocks by taking a walk
* Losing the initial drive is important to look at our work objectively. However, it is not a signal to stop! You must keep moving forward. If the tensions becomes too great, we take a break and allow our unconcious mind to take over
* Tension is also important to force yourself to think at a higher level
  * Galois came up with many of his finest math theorems the day before his fateful duel
  * Set fake deadlines if need be or use publicity to force your brain to overwork. Edison often announced crazy ideas before he was ready to force himself to work
### Emotional Pitfalls
* Being a creative-active person can take an emotional toll and can lead us into traps. Be aware of the following pitfalls:
* **Complacency**: if we rest on our laurels from apprenticeship and stop asking those important and curious questions, our mind slowly starts to seize up
  * Fight this as much as you can by upholding the principles of active wonder and remind yourself of how much you don't know
* **Conservatism**: if you start placing too much emotional weight on your past accomplishments or methods, you will be unable to take the risks required to satisfy your creative brain
  * Conservatism will tie you to comfortable ideas and create a downward spiral
  * Make creativity the goal, not comfort
* **Dependency**: you need to develop internal standards and independece so that you are not completely beholden by the public and can tell if what they are saying is valuable
  * Internalize your Master so that you become both the teacher and the pupil
* **Impatience**: The creative process needs continual work and intensity. Rushing to old ideas will not help
* **Grandiosity**: With enough praise, we will start shifting our goal from creativity to ego, which is dangerous as we start to climb ever-higher on the ladder of ambition
  * Consider public attention as a nuisance and a distraction to prevent this from affecting you
* **Inflexibility**: creativity requires flexibility
* By doing creative work, we acheive the ultimate forms of satisfaction: we are creating ourselves
## Strategies for the Creative-Active Phase

### The authentic voice
* John Coltrane example: Coltrane spent a lot of time experimenting with different types of jazz music and chords until we found something just right that fit his inner voice
  * The resulting music was extremely popular and standard-defining in the world of jazz
* Coltrane spent 10 years learning different music styles in order to create something personal
* As Masters, we also need to spend the time to be rigorous in our fields and trying out new things in order to create something personal to us
### The fact of great yield
* V.S. Ramachandran example: Ramachandran often did extremely simple experiments to understand the root causes of certain neurological anomalies
  * Phantom limb syndrome: experimented with mirrors to determine that a feeling of sight was important in the phantom limb
  * Apotemnophilia (desire to ampute a limb): talked with patients and did simple galvanic testing and noted that the brain's map of the body was incorrect
  * Ramachandran had a rigid criteria on which anomalies he would research
* Be an opportunist like Ramachandran and go look for facts of great yields, evidence that if the underlying system is proven, could have great application
* Have a criteria on ideas you want to investigate and look at anomalies for a variety of fields, even ones you are not an expert on
### Mechanical intelligence
* Orville and Wilbur Wright example:
  * Both brothers had a knack for mechanical contraptions. Before they figured out flight, they were very involved in bicycle repair and creating their own bicycles (which they often tested their own modifications)
  * When Wilbur analyzed avation experts at the time he noticed that:
    * They weren't in the air long enough to figure out what to improve on, so they couldn't really do good repetition
    * Experts overvalues stability, which made poor airplane designs
  * Wilbur convinced his brother and applied the MVP principle to their plane and making modifications until they created the first motored airplane
* Be willing to improve on your project through repetitions and using it yourself to understand the limitations
### Natural powers
* Santiago Calatrava example:
  * Calatrava liked architecture, but he was worried that the natural constraints of building projects would kill his passion for architecture
  * He developed a unique process to combat this:
    * He always started off with several hundred hand drawings and slowly built connections as the building took shape in his mind
    * He was willing to always start over in case any part of the design didn't hold up after months of working on the design
    * Since he started from drawings, any constraints (eg. money, materials) were more creative challenges than blockers
* Since we usually don't have mentors in the creative-active stage, we need to develop our own processes for creating creative works, like Calatrava
* Some tips for crafting your own creative process:
  * Always include a divergent thinking at the very beginning
  * Make sure to read widely and incorporate ideas from different domains
  * Never be complacent and constantly work on improving your ideas. Frame your obstacles with this in mind
  * Never be impatient. Time is your greatest ally as you slow cook your ideas
### The open field
* Martha Graham example: 
  * Martha learned Denishawn ballet from a few well-known ballet dancers, but she felt that the style was missing expression that she wanted to bring out from herself
  * She invented her own dance style, complete with different training, different poses and different costumes
  * It was so powerful that it created a bifuraction in public opinion (a signal to it's power)
* Every field is littered with dead paradigms. If you want to create a new one, look within yourself to see if there's something that you desparately want to express
* Once you have found something, be brave and execute on it, even if it goes against prevailing wisdom
* This is not the same as wild spontaneity, because it requires you to use your past knowledge to diligently subvert your discipline
### The high end
* Yoki Matsuoka example:
  * Matsuoka spent a lot of her time building a robotic hand at MIT, going against conventional logic and spending time on imitating human anatomy
  * Her work became the standard for robotic hands
* Constantly remind yourself of the purpose of your work to avoid getting hard-locked into a particular strategy
### The evolutionary hijack
* Paul Graham example:
  * Graham came upon the idea of a web application for ecommerce while everyone else was building desktop applications. This allowed him to iterate faster than anyone else
  * He also came up with the idea of YC by giving a talk at Harvard and starting off with 'lousy' entrepreneurs and building himself up to a formidable investor
* What constitutes true creativity is a certain fluidity of mind, where accidents can create sparks in your head on how to approach something differently
### Dimensional thinking
* Jean-Francois Champollion example:
  * No one was able to crack the Rosetta Stone, but Champollion took a different tack. He first learned Coptic in order to decipher Demotic and spent all of his time obsesseing
  * After a break due to governmental instability, he came back and realized that hieroglyphics was a combination of ideograms and visuals. He attacked the problem in wholly different angles than anyone had done before and managed to crack it
* It's often important to have holistic view of the subject you are tackling rather than coming at it with simplifications and formulas, tackling with different angles
### Alchemical creativity and the unconscious
* Teresita Fernandez example: 
  * She often created crazy public artworks by mixing around with materials and scale
* Actively explore the unconcious and contradictory aspects of your personality and surroundings
## Reversal
* Don't fall for the myths that creativity is from madness or drugs. It's from pure effort
# Fuse the Intuitive with the Rational: Mastery

## The Third Transformation
* Marcel Proust was an excellent writer and decided to write about his experiences interacting with the Parisian elite
* His first novel was a failure, so he decided to devote his time studying other authors and become an expert in language
* Due to his wide reading and self-apprenticeship, Proust was able to publish some insanely successful and creative novels where he mixed history, elite culture and his own experiences
* In fact, his habit of incorporating his own experiences was what made him so successful, as he was able to relate directly to the reader
## Keys to Mastery
* Masters were the paragons of their field because they had intuition: they were able to make sense of a situation and see more than other practioners
* Intuition is a valid form of intelligence but much harder to teach, but it is accessible to all
* Through long periods of familiarity and hard work, the master is able to understand the whole very deeply
  * Often times, masters need to verify their intuitions in a rational manner. Darwin spent years analyzing the evidence of his intuition about evolutionary theory
* The time that leads to this level of mastery is dependent on our intensity of focus
  * As we start as an apprentice, we need to be continuously aware and start to build a mental model. The richness of this model depends on our attention to everything around us
  * This is exactly what Proust did: he spent years of intense focus on his various interactions and actions, even though it looked like he was wasting time on the outside 
### The Roots of Masterly Intuition
* Human ancestors developed a primitive form of intuition to offload mental compute for tasks like detecting predators, finding food & water, etc.
* Human intuition is based primarily on memory, which in turn is based off attention that we have paid to things in the past
* These memory networks in our brain allows us to come to creative solutions only if the network is big enough
* The need to attain intuition is more important than ever as our world becomes more and more complex
  * Most people will try to ignore or remove the complexity, which doesn't work and can backfire
  * The only way to handle complexity is to train Negative Capability and work on the skills to help you make sense of the complexity
* Since memory is so important, try to train it on your own time through fruitful hobbies
* Being able to harness intuition separates you from everyone else, as you can execute much faster than anyone else despite ambiguity
### The Return to Reality
* Throughout our work, we have been segmenting skills and fields, but as a master, you will primarily create your biggest gains when looking at things at the whole
* Focus on relationships between fields
## Strategies for Attaining Mastery
* Masters often don't seek the normative career path and have a strong guiding compass on what they want to do. They often go down an unconventional route
### Connect to your environment - primal powers
* Polynesian navigators example: 
  * Polynesians had no tools to navigate, yet they often travelled thousands of kilometers to reach certain islands or land masses
  * When Westerners tried piecing it together, they realized that the master navigators were using memorized star charts, sensitivity to currents and winds and nearby animals
  * In other words, they were looking at everything to determine their current location. Furthermore, they only spent a few minutes absorbing all of this
* A deep connection with our surrounding environment can help us become ultra-masters, where no change goes without notice
* This will require us to throw out the distractions of technology for worship of intellect
### Play to your strengths - supreme focus
* Albert Einstein example:
  * Einstein spent years pondering the problem of relative time and finally came upon it with an argument with his friend
  * Every day, he spent time working through paradoxes. He even chose a lesser job in the patent office so that he could have more time to think
  * He was also unconventional because he didn't do this through academia, because he hated the structure
* Einstein did three things to help him become a master: he chose to not focus too much on experimental physics (which was common), he attacked the problem from outside academia and he spent much of his free time playing the violin to foster those latent connections
* Lean on your strengths with intensity to become a master
* Temple Grandin example: she spent a lot of time with animals which helped her with autism research, which she had herself
* Like Grandin, we should focus on our strengths and uniqueness, however weird they might be. For Grandin, it was her empathy for animals, which helped her become successful. Don't fall prey to conformism
### Transform yourself through practice - the fingertip feel
* Cesar Rodriguez example:
  * He worked really hard to become the best fighter jet pilot. He was able to develop insane concentration powers because of how hard he practiced
  * In an Iraqi firefight, he managed to down two jets through a combination of tactics that he couldn't conciously remember. This was the sign of his mastery
* Like Rodriguez, we need to aspire to work really hard to make complex tasks like second nature. As you free up your brain, you will able to think on another dimension and can fuse mind and body
### Internalize the details - the life force
* Leonardo da Vinci example:
  * da Vinci spent a lot of time on the details of his paintings, giving his work almost a life-like quality. It created a weird aura and men particularly were enchanted
* What Leonardo did differently than other artists in his time was his willingness to spend as much time as possible to absorb details
* Think of your work as a life. It only will come to life into other minds if you are willing to spend the time to add in the details
### Widen your vision - the global perspective
* Freddie Roach example:
  * Roach changed boxing training by doing the following: he obsessively used mitt practice to get a great connection with his fighters and keeping track of opponent's tics to help his fighters gain an advantage
* If you can think beyond the moment and seize the actual dynamic, you can be much more successful because you can strategize and see the picture as a whole
* Observe your rivals and yourself and uncover weaknesses. Your motto should be "Look wider and think further ahead"
### Submit to the other - the inside-out perspective
* Daniel Everett example:
  * Everett spent years in the jungles with the Piraha but he was only able to crack their language by immersing himself in the culture
  * He realized that they have very different thought patterns, so their linguistics didn't quite fit into any known model
* Exploring a subject from the inside-out vs looking at things externally won't get you the great results you were looking for. It appeals to your conformist brain, because you use the latest methodologies to uncover things that just confirm your hypotheses so that you can get recogniztion
* We often justify that looking from the outside preserves objectivism, but it actually comes with a lot of ingrained bias that will cloud the truth
* An inside-out approach develops empathy for the problem and can give you surprising results
### Synthesize all forms of knowledge - the universal man/woman
* Goethe example: he was basically a man of all knowledge, from literature to science
  * He was able to create astounding predictions of the future as he was the ideal Renaissance man and was close to actual nature
* Don't try to segment knowledge into different fields. Learn and synthesize as much as you can, and surprising connections can pop out

## Reversal
* Denying mastery leads to disappointment and powerlessnes -> creates the false self
* The false self is the voice of conformism, societal pressures and ego
* Mastery is an experession of yourself that anyone can do. It can enrich societies. Consuming is really the height of selfishness, as you fear to create
* Alienating yourself from your inclinations will only lead to pain and bitterness

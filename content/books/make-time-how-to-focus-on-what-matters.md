# Introduction

* Two very powerful forces are competing for your attention in the 21st century:
  * Busy Bandwagon: culture of constant busyness where everything is based on how much you can extract out of every single minute of your day
  * Infinity Pools: apps with endlessly replenishing content (streaming, refreshing functionality) leading to endless distraction
* Most of our time is spent by default: meetings take 30-60 minutes even though it only requires about 5 minutes, other people fill our calendar with events
  * We have to be responsive to emails and messaging systems
  * The Infinity Pools are almost full-time jobs, taking up at least 4 hours per day for the average person
* How do we solve this:
  * Willpower isn't an option: technology has made sure that our willpower can be easily overriden
  * Productivity isn't the solution: problem lies in the amount of tasks that we have to do. The faster you run on the hamster wheel, the faster it spins
* In our current day, being productive is now defined by how fast we react to others
* The authors learned a lot from running design sprints at Google and at startups. Here were some of their lessons:
  * Starting the day with one high-priority goal had a huge impact
  * Got more work done when they banned devices
  * Energy is important for focused work and clear thinking
  * Experimentation was an important part for figuring out the right framework

# How Make Time Works

![[Screen Shot 2020-06-14 at 6.47.43 PM.png]]

* Steps to make time:
  * Highlight: choose one thing to prioritize in a day
  * Laser: stay laser focused on the highlight
  * Energize: build energy throughout the day to stay focused
  * Reflect: reflect on your day with a few simple notes
* Highlight:
  * Choose a single activity and protect your calendar
  * Not about want you need to do; it's about what you want to do
  * It's not the only thing that you will be focused on in the day, but it should be the highlight of the day
* Laser:
  * Distractions are everywhere: you will need to find a way to control them and escape the distractions using design thinking
* Energize:
  * To achieve focus, we need energy. That requires us to stay active and take care of our bodies
* Reflect:
  * We need to reflect to understand what we need to improve for the system
  * Determine which tactics you want to continue and which tactics you want to drop
* Start off by using the following tactics as highlights as you gradually implement each one into your system. Refine and improve as you keep moving forward
* Don't try to chase perfection because that is simply a distraction: you need to make the system incredibly personalized to your own body, mind and goal
* The best tactics are ones where it is easy to fit in your schedule

# Highlight

* Busy Bandwagon forces us to do more and become more efficient, but that often just makes us more busy; rather, we should have some medium-sized goals that we can look forward to each day
* The Highlight is quite literally the highlight of the day. This is what you will be focusing on.
* It's not the only thing you will be focusing on; it's simply a priority. This is where you want your attention to be drawn to every day
* Choosing the highlight:
  * Urgency: what's the most pressing thing that you have on your plate?
  * Satisfaction: which thing will give me the most satisfaction by the end of the day?
  * Joy: what will bring me the most joy?
* Choose a highlight that will take 60-90 minutes
* Tactic #1: write down the Highlight
* Tactic #2: Groundhog it
  * Repeat the highlight from the day before for a second shot
  * Repetition can also be used to build new skills, build momentum or keep doing something you particularly enjoy
* Tactic #3: Stack Rank your Life
  * Make a list of the big things that matter in life -> choose the most important thing -> choose the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ... until you build a stack -> use this to choose highlights
* Tactic #4: Batch the Little Stuff
  * Batch the small work into one highlight
* Tactic #5: The Might-Do To-do List
  * Just a list of things you might do. Up to yoiu to take it off the list and make it a highlight
* Tactic #6: Burner List
  * Put one project on the 'front-burner' with all related to-do tasks (left hand column of the page). Shouldn't take up the whole column; white-space is important
  * Put 1-2 projects on the back burner (right hand column) and then a 'kitchen sink' that catches all other tasks
  * Focus on the front burner task and occasionally tend to the back burner and kitchen sink tasks
  * Scrap it every few days when you are finished with the front-burner project and move on to the next project and reallocate resources
* Tactic #7: Run a Personal Sprint
  * Choose the same highlight every day to prevent context switching costs
* Tactic #8: Schedule your Highlight
  * Prevents schedule from being taken over by other things
* Tactic #9: Block your Calendar
  * Prevent others from blocking up your own calendar
  * Don't fill it up entirely with 'me' blocks, prevent anyone from booking over the meeting
* Tactic #10: Bulldoze your Calendar
  * Play around with your schedule such that you create time for your highlight
  * Question why meetings and chats have to be long
* Tactic #11: Flake it till you Make It
  * Bailing out is fine if you're doing something worthwhile with that time
  * Use this sparingly and provide a reason when you are flaking
* Tactic #12: Say No
  * Best way to get out of low-priority obligations is to say no
  * Saying no seems much more uncomfortable than saying yes, but it's all about gracefully turning down a situation and being honest about it
  * You can use the Sour Patch Kids technique: offer something sweet after you say no
* Tactic #13: Design Your Day
  * Basically timeblocking
* Tactic #14: Become a Morning Person
  * Establish a morning routine that eases you into the morning. Give yourself someting to do, regardless of how small it is
  * Design the night before to create the best sleeping environment

  * Refresh your brain with a real break from the work, turn off Internet, and wind down
* Tactic #16: Quit When You're Done
  * Cut the day before you start to feel unproductive

# Laser

* Why are infinity pools so hard to resist:
  * Passion for technology: tech people love to put their top efforts into this, leading to incredibly sticky products
  * Evolution: constantly running experiments to see if new features are working
  * Competition: when one service releases a new feature, another service is forced to release as well to prevent people from putting attention in another service
  * Caveman brains: takes advantage of our attention-seeking brain psychology
* Key to laser focus is to bring barriers back
  * Every time we switch costs, our brain has to load up different things and it becomes hard to get into the zone
* While FOMO may exist for people that are afraid of taking back control and missing out, we should also recognize that this is also making us stand apart from the others
* Tactic #17: Try a Distraction Free Phone
  * Remove all distractions from your phone: social media, any other Infinity Pools, delete email, delete web browser
  * Smartphones still have valuable technology, like music or maps. Keep the ones you find most useful for daily life
  * Remember to start using your phone intentionally
* Tactic #18: Logout
  * Intentionally add as much friction as possible: logout, don't remember, crazy psswd
* Tactic #19: Nix Notifications
* Tactic #20: Clear the Homescreen
  * Another speed bump that forces you to think whether checking the phone is necessary
* Tactic #21: Wear a Wristwatch
  * Replaces the need to check your phone for time, which often leads to a distraction spiral
* Tactic #22: Leave Devices Behind
* Tactic #23: Skip the Morning Check-in
  * Postpone it, because it often leads into a distraction spiral
* Tactic #24: Block Distraction Kryptonite
  * Distraction kryptonite: something that overwhelms you more than anything else
  * How to identify: if the activity leaves you with regret after you have consumed it, that's your kryptonite
  * Put in friction, block the website, turn off Internet
* Tactic #25: Ignore the News
  * Check once a week. Daily news has no impact on you
* Tactic #26: Put Your Toys Away
  * Close all tabs and windows before shutting off computer
  * Sign out of accounts

* Tactic#28: Put a Timer on the Internet
  * Cancel Internetafter a certain time period by creating a vacation timer
* Tactic #29: Cancel the Internet
* Tactic #30: Watch Out for Time Craters
  * Time craters are small distractions that create much larger holes in the day
  * Try to eliminate as many as you can
* Tactic #31: Trade Fake Wins for Real Wins
  * If the task is not scheduled but 'pseudo-productive', then it's not a real win
  * Only tasks working towards the highlight is a real win
* Tactic #32: Turn Distractions into Tools
  * The trick is to purposefully use social media tools
  * Identify the root cause of you joining the social media -> think about amount of time you are willing to spend on the activity and whether the medium is the best way -> figure out a plan on how you will be using the app for your own benefit

  * Ask people to contact you by text/phone,
* Tactic #37: Pretend Emails are Letters
  * Snail mail works perfectly fine: you don't need to instantly respond when you get a paper letter
* Tactic #38: Be Slow to Respond
  * This requires a shift from "as fast as possible" to "as slow as you can get away with"
  * When you email instantly, you are unconciously giving the signal that their priorities are more important than yours
* Tactic #39: Reset Expectations
  * Could say something along the lines of: "I'm slow to respond because I need to prioritize a few projects; if your message is urgent, send me a text."
  * This message provides a sufficient and vague reason for slow emails and also gives an emergency route
  * Most jobs will be OK with you being slow as long as that is made up with better quality of work
* Tactic #40: Set up Send-Only Email
  * This helps you if you need to send emails on your phone but prevents you from being sucked into the time crater that is email

* Tactic #46: Go À - La Carte vs. All-you-can-eat

* Tactic #47: If You Love Something, Set it Free
  * Go cold turkey for a month (no TV) and see how that affects you
* Tactic #48: Shut the Door

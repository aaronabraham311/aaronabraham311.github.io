# Introduction

* AirBnB faced a problem. Copycat named Windu arose from Europe who had a lot of resources and offered to stop in exchange for massive equity
  * Arguments for yes: could expand to new markets
  * Arguments for no: culture clash
  * AirBnB chose to fight and blitzscaled. Got massive capital, expanded worldwide and competed Samwer brothers out of the waters
* Blitzscaling: prioritizing speed over efficiency even during uncertainty
* Tencent was worried about slowing growth and was deciding whether to pursue WeChat development as Kik became more popular
  * Arguments against: could ruin public relationships and financials
  * Blitzscaled and got massive popularity
* Scale-up: startup has good product-market fit, sizable market and distribution channels worked out and needs to start addressing larger market
  * Slack: 5 years after founding, it finally was in a position to scale and did it handsomely
* Why is blitzscaling possible? The internet
  * Allows us to connect with worldwide audiences and create network effects
  * Network effects build competitive advantage that is very hard to overcome because it creates winner-takes-all markets
* Blitzscaling requires counterintuitive business moves because you take on a lot of risk at the risk of losing to competition
* Why is Silicon Valley the centre of blitzscaling? Talent, capital and culture
  * This can be easily replicated anywhere in the world

# What Is Blitzscaling

* Prime example (pun intended) of blitzscaling is Amazon:
  * Scaled from $5.1M ARR & 151 employees -> $1.64B ARR & 7,600 people
* It's deeply uncomfortable and often fraught with challenges bc risky
* Why is risky fine? Because risk of losing is much greater!
  * Being efficient as you blitzscale doesn't matter at all and actively harms you. If you lose, your efficiency doesn't matter at all
* Will be much less than 100% confident on decisions you face and that's OK
  * Mitigate by focusing on only decisions that matter to your relevant hypotheses
* Blitzscaling not only needs someone with courage & skill, but also needs environment willing to finance intelligent risks
* Software is eating up the world, even industries that are more traditional, like car-making or barbershops (Squire)
  * Technology is essentially accelerating the world's clock speed (check out my ECE 222 notes if you don't understand this metaphor)
* Other forms of scaling:

* Classic start-up growth: jumping off cliff and assembling airplane on way down
  * Being efficient allows you to glide to minimize rate of descent
  * This is good when you want to reach P/M fit
* Classic scale-up growth:  already assembled plane & takeoff from runway
  * Growing efficiently with certainty about environment, corporate
* Fast-scaling: flying on plane and jump off to catch supersonic plane
  * Willing to sacrifice efficiency to increase growth rate
  * You're pretty certain about environment. Useful for getting market share and achieving revenue milestone
* Blitz-scaling: jumping off cliff and building rocket ship
  * No certainty and not efficient but can have massive rewards
* Blitzscaling is hard to implement and requires people willing to take a calculated gamble
  * This is precisely why you should do it. Others are not comfortable with blitzscaling, so if you do it right, you can blow them out of the water
* Scaling lifecycle: startup growth -> blitzscale -> fastscale -> scale-up growth
  * Facebook initially had massive growth, slowed down to fastscale when it tried to monetize & move to mobile, then scale-up with Sheryl Sandberg
  * Apple: most iconic products went through this cycle, sometimes without start-up growth and straight into blitzscale
* Three basics of blitzscaling:
  *
    1. Blitzscaling is offensive and defensive: offensive as you can catch market by surprise, leverage to build competitive advantage, opens up access to capital. Defensive as competitors can barely keep up and you are setting pace of the war (classic strategy)
    2. Blitzscaling needs positive feedback loops, leading to winner-takes-all situations: also the 'first-scaler advantage'. Talent and capital attracted to top scaler which thrive off networks, leading to continuous flywheels
    3. Blitzscaling has massive risks: can create mistakes that will sap up time in the future, so put in processes to not only rapidly scale, but also rapidly fix. May require leadership changes & culture shifts (eg. Oracle didn't focus on organization while it scaled which hurt)
* Five stages of blitzscaling:
  * Every stage needs different tools, processes, and leadership styles
  * Stage 1 (Family, 1-9 employees) -> Stage 2 (Tribe, 10s of employees) -> Stage 3 (Village, 100s of employees) -> Stage 4 (City, 1000s of employees) -> Stage 5 (Nation, 10000s of of employees)
    * May not translate well to real life
  * Can also measure stage of scale by # of users, # of customers, revenue
  * You can achieve user scale and not organizational scale (eg. Instagram acquired for $1 billion but had only 13 employees)
    * This is a feature of blitzscaling -> increases profitability
* Three key techniques of blitzscaling:
  * Business model innovation: you need to have a unique way of making money.
    * Technology is no longer a big differentiator and you don't want to have the same playbook as the incumbents in the industry.
    * You need to use technology in a very unique manner.
    * Ideally, this innovation should be thought before you start (eg. LinkedIn) but sometimes can only come up with it when you launch (eg. PayPal)
  * Strategy innovation: high growth is not your strategy; it's your goal.
    * Strategy is about how you get to your and what you should and should not do
    * Good example is network effects: that can you help you reach high growth
    * You need to pursue **exponential** growth. 20% growth YoY isn't enough because you want to have first-scaler advantage and take control of the market
    * Case: Nokia didn't innnovate hard enough and fell because they were afraid of breaking business customs
  * Management innovation: blitzscaling = human resources issue
    * You need to be OK with hiring 'good enough' people, launching flawed products, ignoring angry people and more
# Business Model Innovation

* Internet bubble was mostly due to people copying the same business models and using new technology
* Startups that use very different business models succeed a lot more
* Real value creation: innovative tech + innovative product + innovative business model
* Business model: how company generates financial return by producing, selling and supporting its products
* 4 growth factors to maximize in business model:
  * Market size: hard to predict but can give really high returns
    * VCs are hoping for a few home runs, which can only be maximized if you go for the largest possible markets
    * You also need to consider whether market itself is growing and how much easier it gets to capture larger market swathes as you achieve scale
    * Companies can also increase market size by going into adjacent markets like Amazon
  * Distribution: good product + great distribution > great product + weak distribution
    * Leverage existing networks: PayPal used EBay, AirBnB used Craigslist. Don't want to be dependent because networks can give (eg. Zynga used FB but FB stopped it)
    * Virality: users bring more users. LinkedIn used address book imports & public profiles, PayPal used email (inherently viral) & referrals, Dropbox used partnerships & data storage giveaways.  Make sure retention rates also high. Usually works only for free & freemium models
  * High gross margins: can use margin to reinvest in growth.
    * Software inherently high margin as cost of replication to other user is 0.
    * User doesn't care if its high/low margin product, only that it benefits them.
    * Some companies like Amazon deliberately pursue low margins for market share.
    * Margins aren't usually a problem and rather startup problems come down to revenue/unit volume and supporting it (which eats up margins)
  * Network effects: companies that can use network effects inherent in internet succeed intensely due to flywheels
    * Direct network efffects: increase in usage lead to direct increase in product value (eg. FB and messaging apps)
    * Indirect network effects: increase in usage increases usage of complementary products, which increases usage of original product (eg. Shopify platform encourages buying, making buying products more successful, which attracts more people to Shopify)
    * Two-sided network effects: increase in usage by one set of users increases value to different set of users (eg. marketplaces like Uber)
    * Local network effects: increase in usage by small subset of users increases value for connected user
    * Compatibility and standards: use of one product encourages usage of compatible product (eg. Apple ecosystem, Microsoft office)
    * You must be aggresive when pursuing network effects because initially, it acts against the first few users (this is why Uber subsidizes cost  in a new market)
    * Network effect works really well if users think that future adoption will be high, because they want to start the bandwagon
    * Can also create product such that it is useful without network (eg. LinkedIn profiles work even if you don't have network)
    * Internet dependence on SEO enables network effect and sustains it
    * Companies that have acheived network effects often go to adjacent fields and perform same thing
* 2 growth limiters
  * Lack of product-market fit: if you have it, very easy to scale up
    * Opportunities to create P/M fit is hard to find, but often comes in the wake of some change (technological innovation, new user segment, laws & regulation changes)
    * Use network intelligence (talk to your network) to help you understand whether you have product market fit
    * Try to do research on this before you launch
  * Operational scalability:
    * Human limitations: lots of relationships to upkeep as you scale, which can be difficult
      * Create a smart business model to reduce number of employees (eg. WhatsApp only charged $1/year, didnt hire many people)
      * Outsource your work (eg. AirBnB outsourced photography)
      * Will need to scale up operations if you successfully scale up
    * Infrastructure limitations: limit crashes as you scale (eg. Friendster crashed often, leading to MySpace, Twitter and Fail Whale, Tesla)
      * AWS has limited this and is using power of modularity: making small subsystems necessary for scale
      * China does this for hardware
* Proven business models: not all are equal!
  * Bits rather than atoms: bits/software-based businesses find it much easier to scale and distribute, have high margins, can avoid limiters because easy to iterate
    * Bits can be used to scale up atoms (Amazon software used to scale up physical sales
  * Platforms: lend themselves to network effects and can tax users (eg. iTunes takes 30% share on music on platform)
  * Free/freemium: free has special pricing effect in our mind
    * Make money via freemium
  * Marketplaces: powerful because it taps into 2-sided network effect and can have very efficient pricing
  * Subscriptions: larger addressable market and better distribution (Salesforce and Workday use this) with predicatable income (allowing for aggressive investment)
  * Digital goods: on the line of bits and atoms (eg. video games)
  * Feeds: huge network effect but requires technical sophistication to pull of properly (especially adding ads, like Facebook)
* Underlying principles of business model innovation:
  * Moore's Law: number of transistors that appear on chip double each 18 months
    * Important because it predicts constant state of technological innovation
    * The best entrepreneurs anticipate technological progress so that when it comes, they can take over (eg. Reed Hastings predicted that streaming could be done & personalization)
  * Automation: because of Moore's Law, makes sense to outsource repeatable tasks to computers
    * This enables blitzscaling, as employees can work on harder problems and eventually automate
  * Adaptation, not optimization: need to continuously improve as environments change
  * Contrarian principle: you need to be different than the crowd to get first-scaler advantage
    * Others like to invest in ideas that seem like it works. True business model innovation means that your way of innovation is unproven; it won't get much investor attention
    * You don't want "X for Y" business models (eg. Uber for pets)
* Analyzing billion-dollar business models:
  * LinkedIn
    * Insight was that anonymous web won't be useful for employers, so changed it
    * Used growth hacking techniques to build to one million users, using organic virality & networking
    * Initially used freemium model -> sold to companies to screen candidates
    * Network effects galore because it was a social media website, preventing attacks
    * Quickly found product/market fit by getting market feedback quickly as possible
    * Operational scalability was a challenge because they had to support two different types of products: one for recruiters and one for regular ppl. Sales force needed
  * Amazon:
    * Insight: unlimited digital shelf size -> buy as many products as you like. Started with books because it was the easiest to go to ecommerce
    * Distribution: used affiliate program
    * Gross margins: pretty bad but because they are in retail, however certain segments of their business are high margin (Amazon marketplace, AWS)
    * Network effects: has two-sided network effect in retail and much more in AWS (eg. Docker encourages AWS to use it, which meshes really well with Docker)
    * Product/market fit: markets already had product/market fit so it was really easy but has had many failures (eg. Fire Phone)
    * Operational scalability: one of the best in the world. Really good delegation at top and amazing infrastructure, obviously
  * Google:
    * Insight: get people OFF from Google as fast as possible, which other search engines didnt do. Used AdWords, making much more revenue than other search engines + paired up really well with pace of Internet growth in generl
    * Distribution: relied on existing networks, like AOL and Firefox
    * Gross margins: custom ad bidding made it very profitable. Invested in big bets like Chrome and Android that paid off
    * Network effects: didn't use it in search, but used in Waze, Android, YouTube...
    * Product/market fit: took a long time to get P/M fit. Other products have a barbell distribution in success because high tolerance for failure (unlike Apple)
    * Operational scalability: really good at this
  * Facebook:
    * Insight: quite niche at first (social network for college students) but actually had grander visions
    * Distribution: used virality to distribute products
    * Gross margins: didn't start off with revenue model like Google but once it started ads, became very profitable, allowing it to invest in other tech
    * Network effects: obviously used it a lot. Even APIs were using networks (login)
    * Product/market fit: struggled with moving to mobile, but also not hesitant to acquire other platforms that achieved P/M fit (Insta, WhatsApp), also P/M fit with adverts
    * Operational scalability: initially went very fast with little concern about infrastructure, but had to slow down because infra was breaking

# Strategy Innovation

* Blitzscaling is hard to grasp and apply because it requires throwing all previous principles out (lean startup, business school, etc.)
* The only time it makes sense to blitzscale is if speed into the market is the critical strategy to achieve massive outcomes
  * You don't need to solve your revenue model before you blitzscale
* Not all startups should blitzscale: should have product/market fit & business model should be working. Can lead to blitzfailing
* Factors to determine whether it is the right time to blitzscale:
  * Big new opportunity: dependent on technology limits (eg. YouTube blitzscaled when Internet could support video streaming) and market is huge (eg. Alibaba went ham knowing Chinese middle class was going up)
  * First scaler advantage: want to trigger economies of scale or network effects (eg. Amazon could not compete very well with Ebay bc not the first scaler)
    * Can be specific to particular market/customer segment (eg. MercadoLibre did Amazon for LATAM)
    * Do not confuse with first mover advantage!
    * Not all markets have first-scaler advantages, especially if barely any network effects or customer lock-in
  * Learning curve: first one to climb a steep learning curve (eg. Netflix pioneered video entertainment which is difficult)
  * Competition: you need to blow your competition out of the water (eg. AirBnB blitzscaled when global competitors started arriving)
  * Good times/bad times: blitzscaling can occur at all times. Important to measure rate of growth relative to entire market (eg. Google started scaling right after dot-com bust)
* Focus is on moving faster, so you need to do things that other companies would not be willing to do
  * ClassPass scaled up and hired people on only 2 criteria: person must be in personal network with branded resume & only check for alignment with mission, not skills
* Don't be hyper-risk, but definitely manage your risk more
* If taking on additional cost and uncertainty doesn't confer an advantage, don't do it. Use traditional rules instead
  * LinkedIn didn't hyperscale immediately because they knew that they were early to the market. Once everything was flushed out and people caught up, they blitzscaled
* When have you outgrown blitzscaling?
  * Declining rate of growth
  * Worsening unit economics
  * Decreasing productivity
  * Increasing management overhead
* Can be dangerous to continue blitzscaling when reaching market limits
  * Groupon and Twitter are good examples of companies that stopped too late and had to suffer major costs
* Safest to choose not to blitzscale in a low-margin business model where investors are unwilling to invest (otherwise someone else can fund growth)
  * Beware that things can quickly change (eg. Amazon came in with high-margin business model to fund blitzscaling)
* Blitzscaling requires solving the same problems over again to deal with different stages of the scaling process
  * Step 1: Do things that don't scale to solve problem
  * Step 2: Reach next stage of blitzscaling
  * Step 3: Keep scaling some stuff but also finding unscalable solutions to other problems
  * Repeat
* When you are < 100 employees, you can only move faster than the average startup if:
  * Only competent player in the market (pretty rare)
  * First to figure out brilliant growth strategy
  * Pursuing scale more resolutely: commits & acts on things that achieve scale
* It pays to be aggressive, as expected value is quite high
* If 100 < employees < 1000, speed can change from blitzscaling to scale-up growth to fastscaling
  * Blitzscaling at this stage requires differentiated strategy since everyone is usually aggressive at this stage
* At nation size, scaling a company is about scaling a new part of the company
  * Apple was at nation size in 2007 but scaled iPhones & iPads
* Role of founder in each stage:
  * Family: founder has to do everything to achieve hypergrowth
  * Tribe: founder manages people pulling hypergrowth levers
  * Village: designs organization that pulls levers
    * Founder is much more removed and can't see immediate outcome
  * City: founder makes strategic decisions
  * Nation: founder stops org blitzscale and blitzscales new products
# Management Innovation

* Key transitions:
  * Small teams to large teams: small teams are much more adaptable but large teams require much more coordination and planning
    * Early employees may face challenges as their importance degrades
    * Add commando-type workers to new areas of org and police-type workers to older areas
    * People themselves need to scale and they may not be the best fit at every startup stage. Make this clear to early people and focus on responsibility changes rather than title changes
  * Generalists to specialists: early stages need few people who can do everything decently well, later stages need more people who are specialized to scale in a particular function
    * Generalists can be re-deployed to other functions as company scales
    * Very dangerous to hire specialists early because they are wasting talent
    * This transition can strain morale and make sure generalists don't leave. If they do, at least make it amicable for alumni network
    * Take in very smart generalists (defined by pedigree or past experience) in Family and Tribe stage and start taking specialists in Village
  * Contributors to managers to executives: managers are frontline leaders (tactical) while executives manage managers (strategic)
    * Tribe needs managers, villages need execs
    * Manager -> exec transition is much more difficult than contributor -> manager transition. There is always a leadership vaccum in startups
    * Shouldn't wait to hire execs because stress will make it worse and worse
    * Exec hiring should be very careful and should only hire them if they have the skills to blitzscale and can blend well with culture
    * Can hire execs from outside in roles where your company is not strong but get strong internal hires for company function strengths
    * Hire execs that are known to company leaders, hire from lower levels to make them prove themself and then promote
    * Blitzscaling requires organization, which needs hierarchy
  * Dialogue to broadcasting: shift from in-person discussion to online 'push' and 'pull' messaging alongsides changing privacy of information
    * Family startups can easily communicate or even use async platforms like Slack
    * As you grow into Tribe, you will need to have 1:many dialogue events, like weekly company meetings (should be organized, no decision making, gather as many opinions, include 'rituals')
    * Village cannot have weekly meetings. Lower frequency and use video conferencing, weekly emails to maintain connections
  * Inspiration to data: will need to start using data more to reach larger audiences
    * You don't need a lot of analytics in Tribe and Family stage because you are still tuning
    * As you get bigger, you need a framework on how you want to achieve goals, which often requires data to work
    * Pick a north star and invest in infrastructure to track datapoints as you scale. Will provide a little bit of certainty in an uncertain time
    * North star metric changes as you grow but it's important to still keep old metrics around for continuity
    * Beware of vanity metrics: these are metrics that paint a rosy picture but are not that important (eg. page views, API calls)
    * Data can be spread via osmosis at earlier stages but will need common dashboards as you grow
    * Bigger companies have growth teams that combine data with marketing, product and engineering to get globally optimal results
    * Ensure that you also take qualitative data
  * Single-focus to multithreading: startups in the early phase of blitzscaling have a singular focus, but will need to manage multiple product lines later
    * Singular focus is extremely powerful and can give you a great advantage over multithreaded competitors (eg. Dropbox vs. Drive)
    * Multithreading starts in City stage where you are big enough to start multiple startups within your org that is focused on one thing. The leaders of these threads should have freedom to innovate and ability to coordinate with othe threads
    * Multithreading can help tackle problems where a single thread may not be sufficent (eg. Swiss army knife needed to improve Linkedin engagement)
    * Multithreading cost: products may not fit well
    * Deciding what not to do is just as important as deciding what to do
    * Only add threads when strategically necessary and consider both costs and benefits. Main product line may require less effort for more gain
    * Make sure value given to leaders of threads will not create competition or detract from the health of the company
  * Pirate to navy: playing offense to playing both offense and defense
    * Early stage startups need to use agility and pure offense, leading to chaos and no strict processes
    * As you grow, you need to transition into a more orderly navy
    * Don't be unethical: if you are taking a potentially suspect decision, ask whether this is meant for everyone or just for yourself
    * Navy needs to play defense in the form of locking out the competition and strengthen your existing competitive edge
    * Establish standards through platforms, give more complete solutions
    * Acquisions become more important in later stages to play defense/offense (eg. Google buys Android and blitzscaled it)
    * You may even order diversionary attacks, such as how Microsoft launched search just to mess with Google as it built Drive
    * If you don't pull this transition correctly, you can end up like Uber in 2017 with mass chaos
    * Create an organization that is decentralized in order to scale in different parts of the world but also have a strong executive team
    * You need structure in management in order to scale. You cannot run a Nation like a City
  * Founder to leader: a founder needs to keep their learning curve ahead of the company's in order to scale themselves
    * Delegate often and hire an executive team. Try to have models for each exec position and hire accordinging to that model
    * Amplify using chiefs of staff and executive assistants who can channel your energy into what is most important
    * You need to make yourself into a learning machine: talk to people who have been there before, read books
    * Get mentors who can act like a personal board of directors and report to them while they give you feedback
* Nine counterintuitive rules about blitzscaling:
  * Embrace chaos: you need to sacrifice efficiency for speed, which leads to chaotic environments
    * Almost everything is unknown initially but you need to manage the chaos and have backup plans
    * Get people who are willing to embrace chaos and go outside of role
  * Hire Ms. Right Now, not Ms. Right: don't hire for the future, hire for what you need now
    * Executives should be able to scale, but thats a secondary concern. They should be able to do their work now
    * Hire people who are self-aware of which stage of a company they like best
    * Be able to let go of people when they are no longer right for the company stage
  * Tolerate "bad" management: you don't have time to recruit the absolute best people so you may need to promote really early
    * May need multiple reorgs a year
    * Management practices that are bad (not taking notes, no 1:1 are fine)
    * Actually keeps you nimble if you face unexpected issues. The secret lies in the ability to constantly adapt and change course
    * This only really works if it is clear that you have an opportunity to win, so employees wont care as much
  * Launch a product that embarrases you: you need to choose between getting to market quickly with an imperfect product or getting to market with perfect product. Choose latter every time
    * You need to have a tight OODA loop so you need user feedback as fast as possible
    * Your instincts are not developed yet at the beginning, so don't go by intuition
    * Don't be ashamed or indicted by product by cutting corners
    * The point is to iterate as much as you can
    * If you are free, you have a little more leeway than if you were a paid product
    * Can even get feedback without actually launching
    * Don't listen too much to anecdotal data and rely on data
    * Steve Jobs and Elon Musk had a certain conviction that their products can hit product market fit immediately
  * Let fires burn: there will always be fires that burn as you build a startup. Prioritize and leave other problems
    * Prioritize using urgency (including problems that can kill ability to grow), efficacy, dependency (if you fight problem A, does that make it easier to solve problems B and C)
    * Raising money may be easier than fighting the fire
    * Hierarchy of problems to solve: distribution -> product -> revenue model -> operations -> competition
    * This is why its crucial to have people that can handle risk and uncertainty. You need commandos, not firefighters
  * Do things that don't scale: you don't have time to make an elegant solution for every problem. A hacky solution is much better than an elegant one
  * Ignore your customers: you don't need customer service as you blitzscale. Again, it's not a big fire. This is a temporary solution
  * Raise too much money: people traditionally don't like raising too much because it dilutes your stake, but it may be necessary to have money in the bank
    * May be useful as a positive signal to let others know that you are a rising force to contend with, discouraging investment in competitors
    * Think of growth as long-term profitability and high spend rate as a step back to move a leap forward
    * Raise enough for 18-24 months of operation
    * Be frugal and spend money only on the most critical things to achieve growth
  * Evolve your culture: hire culture fits and pass on A players
    * Important because it influences how people act when no specific rules given
    * Weave your culture into processes
    * Focus on the function that fits your company best (product, design, etc.) and live it
    * Often times, culture will mimic founder. Requires founder to develop personal relationships at the beginning
    * Two levers for this are communication and people management
    * People management is tricky. When you grow fast and need bodies, you run the risk of developing majority-mercernary workforce
    * Hire people that are additive to your culture, not perfect fits
    * You need diversity, otherwise you get group think or even worse problems
* Scale and jump to new markets from which you scale (Amazon with AWS, Microsoft from OS to Office)
# Broader Blitzscaling Landscape

* You can blitzscale out of tech: Zara, shale
  * All you need is a careful analysis on growth factors and limiters and structure business accordingly to blitzscale
* Blitzscaling large organizations: you can still apply the same principles
  * Advantage #1: Scale
    * Some problems, like AWS, can only be solved at scale
    * Some companies seem to have scale, but they actually have no unity
  * Advantage #2: Iteration
    * You have a lot more resources so you can iterate even with failure
  * Advantage #3: Longevity
    * Some problems take a long time that startups cannot try to solve, like self-driving cars or VR
  * Advantage #4: Mergers and acquisitions
    * Can use it to blitzscale by identifying market opportunities
  * Disadvantage #1: Incentives
    * Incentives don't favour ruthless expansion. Have a something-to-lose attitude, investors don't like it. Benefits not spread evenly among employees
  * Disadvantage #2: Unstaged commitment
    * Sometimes put in a lot of commitment for blitzscaling trials which may fail.
    * Stage commitment so that it is predicated on experiment success
  * Disadvantage #3: Public market pressure
    * Sacrificing short-term for long-term value, which investors in public boards do not like at all
  * Blitzscaling hacks: leverage people with prior blitzscaling experience, including VCs, treat initiative as company within company
* Blitzscaling beyond business:
  * Market size: find alternative, non-financial metrics to track 'market' size
  * Distribution: crucial to have some distribution strategy to deliver value to as many people as quickly as possible
  * Gross margin: find alternatives for impact/effort spent
  * Network effects: piggy back on already existing network effects
  * Product/market fit: because non-profits are outside of market levers, this doesn't really exist. However, quality/impact is very important for success
  * Operational scalability: may require using business models that don't need that many employees because capital is scarce for non profits
* Defense against blitzscaling: make your decision quickly
  * Beat them: assess whether competitors blitzscaling will be likely to succeed. If not, don't react
  * Join them: launch your own blitzscaling if market seems ready or acquire, beware culture clash
  * Avoid them: migrate to less vulnerable market

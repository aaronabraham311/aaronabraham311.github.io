# Introductions

* Society is now full-on addicted to their phones
* Companies are now realizing that their survival depends on strength of habits they can form with their product
* First-to-mind solutions are now winning (Facebook, Twitter, Google)
* Hook cycle:
  * Trigger: external or internal triggers begin to associate with another
  * Action: behaviour done in anticipation of reward
  * Variable reward: needed to create cravings. Variability multiplies this
  * Investment: user puts something into system that seems to improve system for next time
* Access + data + speed = more habit-forming world
* NOTE: each chapter has series of practical questions that are worthy exercises for product building

# The Habit Zone

* Habits: brain takes shortcuts and stops actively deliberating on next step
* This is useful for businesses as they can mold human behavior to use product without overt call-to-actions
* Habit building is only really needed for companies that have products that require ongoing, unprompted user engagement
* Habits drive higher customer lifetime value (CLTV), can be used to create flexible prices, creates brand evangelists, less susceptible to competition
* Decrease viral cycle time, which is the amount of time it takes for a user to get another user on to the product
  * Daily users is a great accelerant
* Products capable of altering long-term behaviour are incredibly rare because killing old habits is really difficult. These new habits must happen often
* To convert events that happen infrequently into habits, you need to create high utility
  * Amazon did this really well by becoming the one-stop shop and even advertising competitor prices on their website

* There is no universal timescale to create habits: each business takes own time
* Build painkillers, not vitamins. Painkillers are addictive
  * More like solving itches than actual pain. Build itchkillers. Social networks are not solving a huge problem, but they are scratching some itch
  * A lot of habit-forming products migrate from vitamins to painkillers

# Trigger

* Habits are built off triggers
* External triggers: external stimuli embedded with information that tells user what to do next
  * Information can be implicit (like a button) or explicit (text/visuals)
  * Paid triggers: ads, but quite costly and unsustainable if high churn
  * Earned triggers: require time invesment, like media or viral videos. Often not very long lasting
  * Relationship triggers: use relationship networks to trigger behavior (eg. Clubhouse invites). If used unethically, can actually cost social currency
  * Owned triggers: own a part of user's attention, through app icon or email
  * External triggers must lead into internal triggers
* Internal triggers: coupled with emotion, thought or existing routine
  * Negative emotions are often powerful triggers and can be minor. We use products to scratch/cure the itch
  * Information on what to do next is coded within the mind as part of internal trigger, but this association may take time
* To build products for triggers, you need to deeply understand the user's problems and habits
  * First: identify painpoint in emotional terms and look at other successful habit-forming products. Focus on what the user does rather than what they wish they do. Look for the 'whys' behind the action (5 why method) they take to understand core emotions and write narratives in the shoes of a user
* Instagram uses photos as external relationship trigger while the app icon itself becomes an owned trigger. Media coverage and App Store placement are earned triggers. After lots of use, Instagram is associated with FOMO, leading to strong habits

# Action

* The trigger to the product is useless without action. This action must cost minimal mental effort, otherwise it won't be done
* Fogg Behaviour Model: behavior occurs if motivation, ability and trigger are present at the same time
* Motivation is basically potential for action. Three core motivators: seek pleasure, seek hope, seek social acceptance
  * This is necessary to translate trigger to action
* Ability: make the action as simple as possible and remove as many steps to get from user has trigger to user does action.
  * Simplify via time, money, physical effort, brain cycles (mental effort & focus), social deviance, non-routine (match existing routines as much as possible)
  * Find the scarcest resource above and simplify
  * Examples: Google + Facebook OAuth, embeddable tweets, quick search from Google, taking pictures from lock-screen on iPhone, infinite scroll
* Start with ability since building out motivation is time-consuming and expensive
* Scarcity effect: scarcity acts as a signal so people value scarce products more
* Framing effect: context of action influences greatly
* Anchoring effect: use one piece of information when making decisions (eg. discounts at stores makes people buy more because they think they are getting a deal)
* Endowed progress effect: create illusion that you have already completed a part of the action and people motivated to complete whole thing

# Variable Reward

* What draws us to act is not the reward itself but the anticipation of the reward
* Products must always have an ongoing degree of novelty, so variability is pretty important
* Variable rewards come in three types:
  * Tribe: we crave social validation. Social networks use variable content/engagement from users to create more variable reward
  * Hunt: we crave getting resources. If these resources are variable (eg. gambling machines), it becomes particularly sticky
  * Self: driven to overcome obstacles, even just for the satisfaction doing so
* Understand what reward truly matters to users (social validation from Quora vs. money from Mahalo) and if you are actually scratching the user's itch
* Make the reward more frequent (eg. Mailbox has more frequent Inbox 0 moments by smartly moving emails into smaller folders)
* Make sure that rewards are not overtly manipulating users, otherwise autonomy is broken and users are angry
  * Reinforce user's freedom to choose, which leads to sticky products
* Naturally, users will get bored with variable rewards so make sure the product is infinitely variable

# Investment

* Investments can change our attitude towards habits, which create loop. This is because investment causes people to place higher value in product
* IKEA effect: we irrationally value things that we have invested in as higher
* Little investments can lead to bigger changes in behaviour as we want to stay consistent with past behaviour
* Humans try to minimize cognitive dissonance as much as we can
* You can use above three points to influence users to put something into product to make them use it again. This must come after reward
* If the product becomes more useful with increasing investment, then it will be a great end to the habit loop
  * These become a moat as people cannot imagine how much time it takes for a come-up product to reach the level of utility as another product because long periods of investment is needed
  * Data, reputation, skill and content stores these investments
* Just like the action phase, the Investment phase must consider if the investment has sufficient motivation and ability from user
* Set future triggers in Investment phase, which shortens habit cycle
  * Ex: Snapchat's communication method bakes in next trigger within investment of sending picture to friend

# What Are You Going to Do With This?

* Power to build manipulative products should be used with extreme caution
* Ask two questions: would you use this product? Does it materially improve a user's life?

* Facilitator: usually facilitating some healthy habit
  * Don't justify your answers, just answer truthfully, unless you are considering usage at different points of your life (although the questions don't become that accurate)
  * You want your product to be in this sector
  * Protect users who are using product too much
* Peddler: often products that attempt to make something more fun, but actually doesn't provide a lot of value
  * Much harder to develop user empathy needed to develop features
* Entertainer: this is important for its own sake
  * These products usually tend to fade out over time
* Dealer: actively harmful
  * People do not have the mental antibodies to protect themselves against this behaviour

# Habit Testing & Opportunities

* The Hook Model is only a guideline. Every single product will have a separate way of creating a habit, so you need to continously experiment
* Testing habits:
  * Step 1 - Identify:
    * Define what is a devoted user in terms of app usage.
    * Then look at the data and identify how many actually meet this threshold and the type of people that do (cohort analysis)
  * Step 2 - Codify:
    * Define a goal of how many hooked users you want (start off at 5%)
    * If you don't have 5% of users habitually using your product, you either looked at the wrong users or your product needs work
    * Codify the steps for hooked users to understand how they got hooked
    * Create the habit path by looking at all parts of the funnel
  * Step 3 - Modify:
    * Revisit product to strengthen habit path
* Habits are not the be-all and end-all for products. You need to create product-market fit and a sound business model to actually succeed
* Look at opportunities in your own life to make a facilitator product
* Other opportunities to 'habitify':
  * Nascent behaviours: initially start out as toys and vitamins, but turn into powerful pain killers
  * Enabling technologies: new technologies that make existing behavious easier. Look out for new infrastructure
  * Interface change: look at how people change their behaviours when technology changes

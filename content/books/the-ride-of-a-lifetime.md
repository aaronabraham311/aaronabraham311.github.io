# Leadership principles from Bob Iger:

1. Optimism: should be pragmatic and should be there even in the face of difficult choices and less than ideal outcomes. People are not inspired by pessimists
2. Courage: risk-taking and innovation is vital
3. Focus: prioritize the problems and projects of the highest importance and allocate time and energy to improve those problems
4. Decisiveness: all decisions can and should be made in a timely fashion. Indecision is inefficent and corrosive to the team morale
5. Curiosity: enables discovery of new things
6. Fairness: always treat people fairly and decently. Empathy is essential
7. Thoughtfulness: take the time to develop an informed opinion
8. Authenticity
9. Relentless pursuit of perfection: refuse to accept mediocrity or "good enough"
10. Integrity: always set high ethical standards. The way you do anything is the way you do everything

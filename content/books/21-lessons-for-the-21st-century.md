# Disillusionment

* 3 major stories: fascism, communism and liberals
  * Only liberalism succeeded
* Disillusionment with liberalism is rising and liberals think apocalypse going to happen
* Not prepared to deal with with internet and technology
  * Don’t know how to use this correctly —> breakdown of ourselves
* Problem: people feeling irrelevant, technology too advanced and people feel like they’re falling behind
  * Class distinctions based on information: people that know a lot and can keep up > those that cannot
  * Liberalism meant for ordinary people, not high tech world
  * Populism is way of reacting to irrelevance by using political power
* Has had bouts of confidence issues before
* New movements are no longer global visions with wide consequences
  * Ex: Russia’s oligarchy, caliphates
  * Trying to follow own nationalistic tale, all idiosyncratic
* Liberalism always used economic growth to overcome problems; but now, it is causing the problem

# Work

* Machines best at physical, now slowly become better at cognition
  * Immense benefits to humans but may take jobs
* Jobs likely to be lost: highly specialized and routine task jobs
  * Family doctors automation > nurses
* Job opportunities in servicing and leveraging AI
  * Problem: harder to retrain uneducated unemployed people
    * New useless class. Labour shortage and unemployment
  * More volatility as AI continues to imprve in jobs —> displace people from livlihood
* Ways to solve
  * Slow down tech adoption: subsidize lifelong learning to get trained professionals ready
  * Universal basic income and service
    * Countries that are actually affected might not have $ to serve people; should be global
    * Must define basic human needs: strong communities, meaningful pursuits...

# Liberty

* Individual freedoms and economic liberalism is foundation of Western liberalism
  * Based on human feelings, not rationality
* Computer algos might be able to better understand human feelings —> better descisions
* Biotech and infotech: can detect diseases —> will be ‘sick’ constantly as  sensors can predict very early
* Algorithms don’t have to be perfect, just better than humans
* No longer autonomous individuals <—- democratic liberalism decreases
* Algorithms can make better ethical decisions as they are coded into them
* Robots won’t rise up, but are too obedient (eg. if code is cruel, robot will follow the instructions perfectly)

# Technology

* Globalization and technology will create huge inequalities:
  * Rich can go into biological supremacy and get even more richer —> inequality rise
* Person that is most powerful is person with control of data
  * Big companies try to store our data. We are the products
* Solution: find a way to regulate data to prevent ultrapowerful corporation

# Community

* Sociopolitical upheavels <— lack of human communities
* Humans need intimate communities
* Offline communities are especially important as we are starting to ignore physical feelings for online communities
* People less and less atuned to physical —> disoriented

# Civilization

* Religion is what you make of it: no set definition
* Human groups are special among animal groups as we merge
  * Usually merge from economic interests or war (effective)
* World groups changed from having links to sharing same polutical beliefs —> inherent to successs of that country
* Continue to become more and more interdependent; clash of civilizaton theory is wrong

# Nationalism

* Not normal to humans —> huge social construct
* Mild patriotism is necessary for huge systems to work
  * Requires education and propaganda
* Problem: ultra-nationalism (my country > all)
  * Problems of war from nationalism has been forgotten
  * Ecological problems hard to solve with nationalism becasuse of uneven consequences and global problems
  * Technological problems cannot be addressed as tech is independent of national interests. Competition between nation increases —> high-risk/high-reward technology in research
* Divided world is unable to solve these challenges
  * Must complement local interests with global obligations (EU)
  * Should globalize politics: weight global matters more

# Religion

* 3 types of problems in 21st century: technical, policy and identity and only religion can help with identity problems
* Religious leaders not great at solving technical and policy problems and can only intrepret why they are problems
  * Religion has turned into approval stamp, not origin of solutions
* Religion is crucial in defining us vs. them —> handmaid of nationalism
  * Makes more problems as it results in more divisions

# Immigration

* People migrate to places with best track record of accepting refugees
* 4 debates:
  * Should countries allow immigrants
  * Are immigrants assimilating
  * Should immigrants be equal once they assimilate
  * Are the immigrants fulfilling debate 3?
* Debate 1:
  * Pro-immigration: human obligation, bst to legalize smth. that will inevitably happen
  * Anti-immigration: no obligation <— right to defend against invasion, wants to prevent citizenship (Qatar)
* Debate 2:
  * Pro-immigration: no one follows universal European values, so why should immigrants?
  * Anti-immigration: allows intolerant people, need to accept culture fully
* Debate 3:
  * Pro-immigration: should not take too long
  * Anti-immigration: long probation
  * Dissonance between personal timescale and collective timescale
* Debate 4:
  * Pro: goverment not following 3
  * Anti: immigrants not following 2, so 1 and 3 should not follow from government
  * Tend to weight violations of boths sides > compliance of both sides
* Culturism is rising: one culture is superior to another
  * Cultural norms clash: Warmlandia and Coldia example
  * Discrimination against cultures until culture conversion
* Culturalism problem:
  * Culture only superior in specific contexts, not objectively superior
  * Claims about superiority are not objective
  * Used to judge individuals
* Culturalism often leads to imbalance in representation, but often makes ense if viewed in cultural terms

# Terrorism

* Terrorism doesnt kill a lot, fuelled by fear
  * Trying to force a stronger nation to act foolishly
* Based on theater acts —> can play on fear. Therefore, combat terrorists like theater act
* Terrorists raise impossible challenge to governments: protect all citizens of political violence anytime and anywhere
  * Pursuit of completing challenge leaves country in dire straits
* Problem: terrorism undermines legitimacy of government
  * Peace = natural right now. Small violent acts —> big shock in peaceful places
* Counter-terrorism on 3 fronts:
  * Hit terrorists in clandestine fashion where it hurts
  * Media cannot fuel hysteria
  * Stop imagining terrorist and fear
* Cant use theoretical threat of nuclear/bioterorrism to justify why terrorism is a concern <— huge opportunity cost

# War

* Current years seems just like 1914, except we are all know that war is not the solution in solving problems
  * Crimea invasion only one that was successful, but due to unique conditions (no power stepped in, resistance down)
    * Led to economic sanctions: not worth it
    * Trying to make up for earlier weaknesses
* Russia cannot start WWIII: economically weak, cannot win tech race, no universal ideology
* Wars are hard to win now because:
  * Hard to get economic benefit from war now
  * Cyberwarfare can bring war to aggressor in minutes

# Humility

* Everyone thinks that their culture is the best
* Ethics and morality not tied to a single religion
* Monotheism caused more problems —> intolerance

# God

* Religious laws usually used to legitimize social norm/ political decisions
* Not needed for moral human beings, only need appreciation of suffering
* Religion is double-edged sword: can provide justification for socially productive/unproductive acts (curb anger and terrorism)

# Secularism

* Secular people believe that morals and wisdom is not monopolized in a religion. Follow universal code of ethics.
* Fundamental pillar is truth based on objectivity and not faith
* Another is compassion: base decisions on human suffering
* Tries to solve dilemmas with compassin and choosing least destructive path
* Unknown should be investigated with science
* Responsibility to change world for better
* Religion is fine in secular state so long as secularism > religion
* Problem with secularism: too many ethical standards
  * Difficult to lead people based on secularism
* Religions cannot mistakes, but secularism can

# Ignorance

* We are not rational agents that know everything
  * People make policies about things they don’t understand much about
* Based on groupthink
* If you have power, you will never truly know whats going on
  * Everyone has secret agendas

# Justice

* Modern sense of justice not compatible with millions of people
  * Casual relationships are hard to understand now
* Blissful ignorance can fuel unfair situations (eg. stocks in BEIC)
* Being part of a disadvantaged group doesnt mean you know how other disadvantaged groups feel
* 4 methods used currently to judge large scale dilemmas:
  * Downsize issue to only a couple of actors
  * Personal stories (v. effective compared to stats)
  * Conspiracy theories
  * Ideological dogmas

# Post-Truth

* We were always in the post-truth era
  * We use fiction and myths to create culture —> follow laws —> social harmony
* Propaganda does this all the time
  * Repeat a few lies 1000s of times —> truth
* Mythology needed for mass movements
* Can also bind people by making something seem valuable to everyone else —> gets bigger (eg. currency)
* Humans prefer power and unity to truth
* Fake news is not an easy problem to counter
  * Get permium news, look at peer-reviews papers

# Science Fiction

* Science fiction translates science to real world people
* Free will is product of biochemical reactions —> not really free

# Education

* We already have too much information, no need to cram more
  * Important skill: synthesis and analysis of information
* 4 C: critical thinking, comunication, collaboration, creativity
* Need to be able to deal with change and reinvent yourself
* Old model of study then work will change. Must constantly learn and reinvent yourself
  * Requires mental flexibility and balance
* Know thyself

# Meaning

* Many meanings:
  * Circular: destines for eternal repetition
  * Linear: end with greatness. Religions like Christianity and Islam
* Most is very narrow minded: applies to very specific group of people/place/time
* Other common meanings: leave something behind, legacy, making world a better place, chains of kindness, romance

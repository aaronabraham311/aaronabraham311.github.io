# **Part 1: Study Basics**

* Not about number of avalaiable hours, but how you use each hour
  * Pseudo-worker: spends long time in library, but not focus.
    * This is mentally draining. Try to complete work fast with minimal effort
* Compress into focused bursts (work done = time spent \* focus intensity)
* Requirements: control lifestyle, overcome procrastination and choose right locations

## **Manage Time in 5 Mins. A Day**

* Basic steps: keep calendar and to-do list and transfer back and forth.
  * If non-important or no heavy concentration needed, schedule later at non-busy time
  * Move uncompleted tasks to new dates
  * Use time blocks for daily tasks and group errands
  * Give time for breaks and be finished before bed
  * Be pessimistic as time plans change
* Use list during the day
  * Adjust time labels to account for uncertaininty
  * Need to put down reminders —> good for focus and enjoyment
    * Don't have to schedule entire plan. Put note to schedule and schedule later
  * Can use this in periods of neglect by dumping deadlines as soon as you come back

## **Declare War on Procrastination**

* Urge to procrastinate is always there so learn how to sidestep
* Battle plan No. 1: Work progress journal
  * Note down tasks and say either all completed or provide explanation why not everything is completed
  * Analyze these reasons later and use it to improve yourself
* Battle Plan No. 2: Feed the Machine
  * Maximize mental energy to reduce the probability of procrastinating
  * Drink water and choose healthy meals
* Battle Plan No. 3: Make an event out of the worst tasks
  * Go somewhere else like a cafe to do the most dreaded work
* Battle Plan No. 4: Make a Routine
  * Do same event on same reserved time slot
* Battle Plan No. 5: Choose your hard days
  * Schedule grind days when bunch of deadlines are comping up
  * Temper with non-academic things before and after grind
* Use peer pressure in all plans to force you and stay accountable.

## **Choose When, Where and How Long**

* When: do things early
  * Evenings are not ideal as lots of distractions
  * Do work in middle of class/transition periods and dont distract yourself by going to public places
* Where: in isolation:
  * Rotate between hidden spots (not dorm/library)
  * Must shield yourself from distraction
* Length: less than 1 hour without break
  * Break: 5- 10 mins and do something that is not related to work (novel, newspaper, project, emails, etc.)

# **Part 2: Quizzes and Exams**

* Rote review is essentially pseudo work
* Don’t spend too much time studying for quizzes

## **Take Smart Notes**

* Always go to class
* Online note taking is fine unless it is a STEM course
* Have a folder for each class and save everything
* Non-tech coursers: identify the big ideas
  * Format notes in a way that makes it more understable
  * Write in Question/Evidence/Conclusion format
    * Can format notes like this later, esp. right after class
    * Ask questions to elcudiate this structure
  * Discussions: write topic and insightful points that others/you have said
    * Pay close attention to what the prof says
* Technical courses:
  * Record as many sample problems and deatil explanations
  * Reading only necessary if you dont understand after the rpof says it. Bring it to class and follow along
  * Priority queue:
    * Write question and answer
    * Note any confusing steps and ask
    * Record steps
    * Annotate why you did the steps above

## **Demote Assignments**

* Split up assignments over time (ex: 1 problem/day for problem set)
* Get ahead if you have time, especially during calms in storm
* Don't do all the readings
  * Read sources that often comes in course/prof talks about it/focus of lecture
  * Argument reading > description reading > context reading
  * Schedule non-important readings later
  * Reading notes: do same question/evidence/conclusion format
    * Skim reading and note places of good evidence
* Problem sets
  * Set schedule of days to look over set (2 days before deadline)
  * Use office hours, even if you have solved it
  * Use diffuse thinking if problem is very difficult
  * Do it properly first time around

## **Marshall Resources**

* Studying for test shouldn't be hard
* Define the challenge: understand what you will be tested on
* Study guides:
  * Non technical: print out relevent notes and cluster by topic
  * Technical: add lecture problems with problem sets
    * Add basic technical explanation questions
    * Print practice exams and use it
* Flash cards for memorization
* Don't organize and study on the same day

## **Conquer the Material**

* First review concept then explain in own words
* Non technical: make practice quizzes for each cluster
  * Answer question out loud and write. Not in head
  * Focus on hard questions
* Technical: do same with technical explanation (‘Explain **\_** and why \_\_’) but solve each problem independently
  * Dont use algebra, just pseudo-steps
  * Star problems with difficulty and review again after break
  * DO practice exam at end and review tough questions
  * If labs were tough, review again
* Memorization: use flash cards but spread out use

## **Invest in ‘Academic Disaster Insurance’**

* Prevent bad exams by clarifying everything, especially difficult problems/steps before exam
  * Ask questions during/after class or ask classmates
  * Go to exam review sessions and get doubts cleared

## **Provide ‘A+’ Answers**

* Strategy No. 1: Review First, Answer Later
  * Read over questions and note difficult ones
* Strategy No. 2: Time Budget
  * Lay down time limits for section ( (time - 10) / no. q)
* Strategy No. 3: Go from easy to hard questions
* Strategy No. 4: Outline essays
  * Find actual prompt and recall answers to answer prompts
* Strategy No. 5: Use all remaining time to check. Do not leave until extremely confident
* Strategy No. 6: If you have lots of time to check, check how every other answer is wrong (MC)

# **Part 4: Essays and Papers**

* Paper writing broken into:
  * Sifting through existing arguments
  * Forming own arguments
  * Communicating arguments
* Current way: blend all together —> inefficient
* Either critical analysis (short and precise) or research paper

## **Target a Titillating Topic**

* Key: choose topic that interests you. This can be from class discussion (pay attention to this if you know the class has a paper)
* Write down ideas that pop into head/discussed in lecture
* Trouble: ask prof for readings or read primary sources carefully

## **Conduct Thesis-Hunting Expedition**

* Critical analysis: look at lecture notes and reading --> answer --> thesis
* Research paper: find general summaries —>  bibiliography —> specific sources
  * More likely to find interesting thesis
* Thesis should be provocative, nuanced, direct and inclusive
  * Don’t make it too simple/reductionist
  * Continually developed as paper is written
  * Make new thesis if evidence is not interesting

## **Seek a Second Opinion**

* Ask prof if thesis is appropriate, specific and complex
* Ask for sources/discuss own sources

## **Research like a Machine**

* Find sources
  * Either general or specific for arguments
  * To find specific: look at bibliography of book you already read or similar book
  * Look a specific book categories and search for similar ones
  * Search directly for sources via:
    * Breaking up queries into groups and search
    * Go to journal staabases
    * Google but do not cite websites; simply find sources via Google
    * Ask the librarian: experts in finding sources
* Make personal copies of all sources
  * Advantages; portable, accesssible, easy to annotte
  * Make sure you jot down information for bibliography
    * Can even photocopy copyright info pages
  * Photocopy bibliography too
* Annotate:
  * Just jot down main points relevant to thesis. Skim
    * Staple annotations to source photocopy
* Decide if you’re done:
  * List topics that are crucial and ones that could help
    * need 2 sources for crucial, 1 for anything else

## **Craft a Personal Story**

* Best papers are papers where you made insightful connections
* Argument should: draw on past work, good theses, good evidence and impact
  * No formula for argumentation so practice! Read and listen to good arguments
* Put into minset (read arguments) —> look at source material and follow diffuse thinking
* Make essay outline of topic flow. Find sources for unsupported topics
  * List evidence (quotes are best) for each topic

## **Consult Your Expert Panel**

* More input and feedback lead to a better paper
* Number of people and panel should correlate to importance of paper
  * Prof: show general outline, sources and arguments
  * Smart classmates

## **Write Without Agony**

* To improve writing: write outside of class and look at style guides. On Writing Well
* Separate research, writing and editing
* Most focus on writing: find places of silence and align with high points of day
* Go through outline points 1 by 1 and dont rush

## **Fix, Don’t Fixate**

* First edit: argument presentation (awkward, add more, shift paragraphs). Big part
* Second edit: print copy and read out loud
  * Mark grammar mistakes and awkward construction
* Third edit: print copy and read to find stray mistakes\

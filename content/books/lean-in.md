# **Negotiating**

1. Act nice
2. Act communally (ex: “we had a good year”)
3. Cite other offers

## Salary negotiations

1. Do your homework
   1. Get salary info based on current situation
   2. Are you indispensable
   3. Define ideal offer and lowest offer (BATNA)
   4. Always have backup options
2. No compensation discussions until offer
   1. If interview asks: redirect and ask for their ideal offer.
   2. No option: give low end of your range and high end of their range
3. Negotiate
   1. Communal tactics
   2. Never ask 1st offer —> ask job-related questions and gradually find compensation
   3. Counteroffer: include things aside from salary, like bonuses
4. Accept/decline: always graciousl
   1. Ask when time is right (career is skyrocketing) or undervalued (stay on top of market value)
   2. Be prepared for evolving BATNA and walk away if not met
   3. Aks manager in context of increasing responsibility and value

# **Jobs**

Only criteria for finding jobs: fast growth (take risks)

* Find rocketship in your industry and join

Always have 18 month plan and learn new skills

Go for stretch assignments and high visibility projects and ask for promotion (crown will NOT be placed on your head without you asking for it)

Take intiatives

# **Mentorship**

Mentorship will not alwyas guarantee you to excel in your field. Excellence is a byproduct of mentorship, not a product

Always follow up from advice: thank advice and ask for more

No one has time for excessive hand holding, so do not complain. Ask for actionable advice

Take part in structured mentorship programs

# **Getting 1st Job**

Even if you dont meet all the requirements, apply!

Organize: have a calendar, do research, make contact spreadsheets and create personalized resumes and interview questions for company

Make sure online prescence is solid

LinkedIn profile:

* Get recommendations
* Comment on posts
* Join groups
* Use keywords

Resume:

* Clear and succinct: single page. Education —> jobs (reverse chron) —> skills. Bullet points
* Focus of success: action verbs with accuracy
* Show soft skills: leadership, communication, teamwork and work ethic
* Keywords: function, skills/expertise, qualifications. Use job postings to mine for words
* PROOFREAD
* Customize resume for job and emphasize different skills
* Do not sound overly formal
* Include online presence

Develop and elevator pitch

Need to stand out with email and cover letter

* Address to someone specific
* Personalize based on qualifications, connections, etc.
* Weave in company research into email
* Attach resume into email as PDF

Ground game: job bulletins, company career page, and social media. Use school advisors

Air game: use connections and make goal for each connection on what you would like

* Use social media handles
* Send email to hiring manager/best person if responding to hob posting
* Be bold and creative

# **Interview**

Do homework: products, industry trends, customers, competitors

Mock interview; list things you want to emphasize and use stories

Be preapred for standard questions

Confident body language

Always emphasize what you can offer to company and specifically, interviewers

Insightful questions that do not assume that you have job (salary is a NO-NO)

Look for opportunities to stand out and sell yourself

Follow up with thank you, why you want the job and feedback.

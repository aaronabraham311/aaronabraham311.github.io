# Introduction 
After university, I had to make preparations to move to New York City for my new job. This was a novel experience for me; there were lots of moving parts and everyone that I talked to seemed to be equally confused. This is a guide I wish I had when I was moving to NYC. By reading this, I hope your moving process will be a little bit more organized and that you can catch mistakes early on. 

Given my usual audience of UWaterloo students, I am assuming that you have already lived in the States before and have bank accounts and a Social Security Number set up. If not, I would strongly recommend reading [Irene Zhang's guide on moving to the US as an intern](https://irenexychen.com/blog/2021/08/us-intern-guide-covid); she does an excellent job detailing the logistics of moving to a new country for the first time.

While the title of this guide is specific to NYC, I believe at least 80% of this will be helpful for people moving to other parts of the country.

# Pre-move
## Motivations
This is a step that I believe is the most important in this entire guide and should be done before you even decide to move to the States. Ask yourself this important question: why do you want to move to NYC?

Many people that I know want to move to the city because it has been glamorized. We've all heard Jay-Z's and Alicia Keys' "Empire State of Mind" (in fact, I strongly believe this is every New Yorker's least favorite song, it has been overplayed to death) and social media loves to depict the spontaneous, fun-filled nightlife of the city. However, there is a difference between visiting and having fun in New York City and actually living here. City living is definitely not for everyone; there is little nature, there are a lot of people, and it sometimes feels that you can never escape the busyness life in this city. 

To determine whether the city is a good fit for you, I would encourage you to live in the city for a short term if possible. For current university students, that could mean taking up an NYC internship. For others, it could mean temporarily relocating to NYC in an Airbnb. The process of actually living here temporarily is eye-opening for your criteria in choosing where to live full-time. For example, before I [[co-op-6-growth-engineering-at-ramp |interned]] in the city, I thought I could easily live in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. By the first month of my internship, I realized I was dead wrong; I needed a peaceful and quiet place to live. Furthermore, I realized that I enjoy living close to friends and that I should prioritize this when finding a place. All of these realizations could not have come to fruition if I did not live in NYC for a few months.

I would also strongly encourage people to live in different cities to expand your mental model on what type of cities you would enjoy living in throughout your university internships. Live in suburbs. Live in bustling neighborhoods. Live with your friends. Live farther away from your friends. All of this experimentation will give you more knowledge on what makes you happy and prevents you from falling into mimetic desire.
## Finances
I am not a financial advisor, so please take this advice with a grain of salt and do your own research. I would recommend reaching out to a financial advisor, as the move to the US may have tax implications. The following is meant to provide structure for your own financial plans.

As a Canadian immigrant to the States, there are a couple things you may want to investigate:
1. **Liquidating your TFSA**: The TFSA is a tax-advantaged investment account that residents of Canada can open. Investments can grow tax free in such an account and is very similar to the US's traditional/Roth IRA. Unfortunately, the US does not recognize the tax-free status of the TFSA and it may go through stringent financial investigation by the IRS during tax season as a US resident. Many Canadians choose to liquidate the TFSA to avoid this problem.
2. **Moving financial assets to the US**: The IRS requires filing an [FBAR](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar) if you have foreign financial assets of more than 10,000 USD. Many Canadians choose to move their money to the US to avoid this report. You can look at [Wise](https://www.wise.com) as a potential tool to move large amounts of money without paying exorbitant foreign exchange fees.
3. **Departure taxes**: Many Canadians choose to declare non-residency in Canada to avoid paying Canadian taxes on US income.

Asides from the financial 


- Financial disclaimer
- As a Canadian:
	- Liquidate your TFSA, it will go under stringent financial investigation by the IRS
	- Move as much foreign assets as you can from Canada to the US such that you don't need to file an FBAR. You can use Wise for this
	- Look into departure taxes if you plan on declaring non-residency in Canada for tax purposes
- Look into the different types of investment accounts in the US for knowledge
	- Traditional IRA
	- Roth IRA
	- Roth 401k
## Deciding where to live
- Try to visit NYC before hand and explore a variety of neighborhoods to see what fits your vibes
- Look into Streeteasy to see the average cost of neighborhoods
- Try to find places to crash near your chosen neighborhood
	- Airbnb, but kind of expensive
	- Crash with a kind friend
- Think about your daily and weekly activities. Which neighborhood is best for that?
	- I indexed high on being close to friends since I foresaw myself hanging out with people relatively often
## To solo or not to solo
- I decided to go solo
	- Wanted my own place
	- Even if I started out with roommates, would probably want my own place within a couple of years. I don't want to go through the roommate breakup then and have to rebuy furniture
	- Knew that I could handle living by myself. Not everyone can do this
		- Requires ability to be alone
		- Make plans by yourself (can make a separate post on this)
- Why you want to have roommates
	- Great company to have at all times, social life is easier
	- Can deal with housekeeping together
	- Financially better
## Interior decor
- learn how to decorate (look into my [[interior-design-notes]] for inspiration)
- make a pinterest board with your desired style
- make a priority list of things you need asap
	- P0: mattress, bed frame, kitchen table, cleaning supplies
	- P1: desk, lighting, couch
	- P2: art pieces
- Make a list of things you need to buy so that you can simply execute decisions when you are in nyc
	- Brief aside, [[clear-thinking]] taught me about decision-making strategies like leveraging dead time to make decisions rather than stressing in the heat of the move
## Immigration (for Canadian transplants)
- Follow the advice of your lawyer
- Give yourself ample time to go through immigration. If you need to do immigration on a layover, make sure the layover is 3-4 hours long as it can take a while to get through
	- I made the mistake of only giving myself 2 hours and missed my flight into NYC
- Make sure to bring your physical diploma.
# During move-in
## Apartment hunting
- Number one priority is moving into an apartment
- I would use Streeteasy to book several appointments a day. You need to move fast because apartments get snatched up easily
- Pay attention to 40x salary requirement!
- Factors to look into:
	- How close is it to transit? What is the commute to work like?
	- Reviews of the apartment building: use Google Maps & Reddit
	- Doorman?
	- Inspect the bathroom & taps to make sure you get hot water
	- Is there sufficient space for everything? You don't want to be in a cramped space if you can afford it
- Try to look in an apartment a few days before you start your job
## Decorating your space
- Try to do as much of the intensive furniture buying & selection before you start your job. It is pretty difficult to do this on post-work energy
- Where do you find good furniture?
	- Ikea: Ikea is pretty good and is relatively affordable
	- Facebook marketplace: Some new grads swear by marketplace as you can get some pretty sweet deals. However, evaluate whether the process & time needed to travel all across NYC for FB deals just to save $50-100 is truly worth your time. I did this for a few items and quickly found that it just isn't worth it for me. 
	- Room and board: definitely higher end, but couches are top quality
	- Flexispot: pretty good chair & desk deals
- If you are living by yourself, go for more expensive items that you know will last for a while. You don't need to split it with anyone and it will go with you for a while, so might as well invest
# Post move-in
## Social life
- Should be your number one goal
- Make it a point to find friends and hang out with them
- Look for shared hobbies, go out at night and be open to meeting strangers
- Make sure to also create time for yourself
## Life setup
- Get your driver's license
- Get a phone plan
- Sort your finances and develop a plan
- Develop a routine

# How To Light A Space
[Video link](https://youtu.be/oA-uLPzMilU?si=pp1YdFclg8SN5M-6)
## Introduction
- Lighting has the power to make or break a space.
- Poor lighting choices can ruin a well-designed room.
- The video covers three common lighting mistakes and four useful tips.
## Mistake 1: Incorrect Lighting Temperature
- Using an incorrect lighting temperature is a common mistake.
- Color temperature is measured in Kelvin, ranging from 1000 to 10,000 Kelvin (warm to cool).
- Four main categories of light colors: warm white, soft white, bright white, and daylight.
	- **Warm White (2700-3000K)**
		- Mid or warm golden yellow light.
		- Suitable for bedrooms, living rooms, and dining rooms to create a cozy atmosphere.
	- **Soft White (3000-4000K)**
		- Slightly cooler, yellowish white light.
		- Best for bathrooms and kitchens to create a bright, friendly atmosphere.
	- **Bright White (4000-5000K)**
		- Between white and blue.
		- Ideal for home offices and garages.
	- **Daylight (5000-6500K)**
		- Blue tone light, creating a sterile and cold atmosphere.
		- Used in hospitals, commercial, or office spaces to maximize color contrast.
- Smart LED bulbs can adjust both brightness and temperature through apps or smart devices.
## Mistake 2: Mixing Color Temperature
- Avoid mixing color temperatures in a single room.
- Inconsistent temperatures create a disjointed feel and make decor and skin tones look off.
- In open plan spaces, compromise with a color temperature between warm white and soft white for consistency.
## Mistake 3: Not Layering Lighting
- Use various types of lighting in a room for even light distribution.
- Four types of lighting: overhead, ambient, task, and accent.
	- **Overhead Lighting**
		- Common ceiling lights.
		- Often relied upon solely, which creates unflattering shadows.
	- **Ambient Lighting**
		- Soft, natural feeling lighting like lamps with fabric shades.
		- Spread out across the room for even light.
	- **Task Lighting**
		- Directional lighting for specific tasks like reading or preparing food.
		- Examples: table lamps, bathroom vanity lights, track lights, under cabinet lighting.
	- **Accent Lighting**
		- Aesthetic lighting to highlight certain areas or objects.
		- Examples: recessed LED light strips, spot ceiling lights, track lights.
- Combining different lighting types can elevate the space and enhance design elements.
## Tip 1: Match Lighting Fixture To Other Elements
- Match lighting fixtures to other room elements for a cohesive look.
- This can be done through color, texture, or material.
- Example: Matching matte black hardware with matte black lighting fixtures.
## Tip 2: Diffuse Your Light Source
- Diffusing light sources reduces harsh shadows.
- Use lampshades or opal glass shades to soften and break up light.
## Tip 3: Use Dimmers    
- Adjust the brightness of lights depending on the time of day and task.
- Smart bulbs or traditional dimmers can achieve this.
- Examples: Philips Hue bulbs, Ikea Trådfri system.
## Tip 4: Light Your Outdoor Spaces
- Lighting outdoor spaces can make indoor rooms feel larger.
- Examples: Outdoor sconces, spotlights in pot plants, fairy lights on trees.

# Design Tips For A Small Space
[Video link](https://youtu.be/uy2gXpKpYZw?si=XdeWbhARZDuxhSFf)
## Intro
- Living in a small space can be challenging, especially when balancing form and function while making enough storage for all belongings.
- The video covers 12 design tips to make a small space look and feel bigger.
## Use Multifunctional Furniture
- Ensure every furniture piece has more than one function to maximize space.
- Examples: Storage cabinets that double as benches, rollout storage systems under beds, sofas with storage under cushions.
- Use decor that hides clutter, such as wicker bins, baskets, and trays.
- Consider multifunctional furniture specifically designed for small spaces, like bookcases with fold-down tables, sofas that convert into beds, storage headboards, expandable dining tables, and white blackout blinds that can be used as a projector screen.
## Keep It Organized
- Keeping a small space organized and clean makes it feel larger.
- Be intentional about what you own and where you store it.
- Have specific cupboards or shelves for storage to avoid clutter.
- Periodically deep clean and donate or throw out old items.
- Use a transition box for items you're unsure about, and rehome them if unused for a month.
- Rotate favorite decor items every few weeks instead of displaying them all at once.
- Use a combination of open and closed shelving for storage to balance clutter and personality.
## Paint Walls Light Color
- White or light-colored walls make a space look and feel bigger by reflecting light.
- Dark wall colors absorb light, making a room feel smaller.
- White walls create an open and airy space by maximizing natural light.
- Painting skirtings and door trims a slightly lighter or brighter shade than the walls enhances the effect.
- Keeping the color palette to a minimum simplifies the space and reduces visual clutter.
- Light or neutral shades for furniture can continue the illusion of a larger space.
## Accent Wall
- Accent walls bring attention to one area of the space, allowing other areas to breathe.
- Examples: Painting a wall, fireplace, or door in a different color or using wallpaper with a large pattern.
## Mirror & Reflective Surface
- Mirrors trick the eye into perceiving more space by reflecting light and color.
- Placing a mirror opposite a window reflects light and makes the space feel larger.
- Tall and slender mirrors draw eyes upwards, creating a sense of height.
- Reflective surfaces like glass or marble on tabletops can also enhance the sense of space.
- Resting an oversized mirror on the floor can be a less permanent option for renters.
## Low Profile Furniture With Legs
- Smaller furniture creates breathing room between pieces, making the space look bigger.
- Low-profile furniture with legs allows light and air to flow under and around it, enhancing the feeling of openness.
- Consider using alternatives like side tables instead of coffee tables or mounting a TV to avoid large media consoles.
## Round Shaped Furniture
- Round furniture pieces take up less space and create a feeling of softness by avoiding harsh corners.
## Leave Enough Space Between Furniture
- Avoid cramming in too much furniture; maintain 45 to 60 centimeters between pieces for walkways.
- Pulling the couch away from the wall can create a sense of roominess.
- Angling furniture pieces in a corner can make the space feel bigger.
## Emphasize Vertical Elements
- Vertical wall paneling, floor-to-ceiling shelving, and hanging bare bulbs create the illusion of more height.
- Horizontal wall paneling and longer furniture items can emphasize the width or length of a room.
## Roller Blinds / Lightweight Curtains
- Blinds maximize daylight by fully exposing the window.
- Curtains can create a cluttered feeling and block some light.
- Lightweight, breezy fabrics in neutral shades for curtains can work if blinds aren't preferred.
- Hang curtain rods high and extend them horizontally beyond the window frame to maximize sunlight and create a sense of height.
## Layer Your Lighting
- Use overhead, ambient, task, and accent lighting to make the room feel spacious at night.
- Slender floor lamps and recessed or track lighting are good options to avoid imposing on the space.
## Sliding Doors
- Sliding doors save floor space by sitting flush to the wall when open.
- Pocket doors slide into a cavity next to the wall, creating the illusion of a larger space.
# 10 Living Room Interior Design Mistakes
[Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgv6agpdIBs&list=PLZp7xLmGZu89JTdgobNKgEJgOu0rg5PaR&index=3)
## Intro
- Designing a living room that is beautiful, comfortable, and functional can be challenging.
- The video covers the 10 most common living room design mistakes and tips on how to fix them.
## Poor Layout
- Pushing all furniture against the walls may seem like a space-saving solution but can create a poor layout.
- Start with a sketch of the space using pen and paper or software like Rayon.
- Consider the desired use of the room and a focal point.
- Arrange furniture to create an intimate seating area, avoiding shouting across the room.
- Pay attention to traffic flow, ensuring major walkways are roughly 36 inches wide and smaller rooms 24 inches.
- Avoid blocking doors and account for door swings to prevent obstacles.

## TV Too High
- Mounting the TV too high forces viewers to strain their necks and disrupts visual harmony.
- Consider using a bracket to lower the TV or opt for a frame TV that blends in with the room’s aesthetics.
- Position the TV at eye level when seated, and avoid placing it too high.
- If dealing with a fireplace, position the TV on a perpendicular wall or the same wall but to the side.
## Scale & Proportion
- Scale refers to the overall size of an object, while proportion is the balance of components in relation to one another.
- Avoid oversized furniture in small living rooms and undersized items that make the space appear awkward.
- Follow the Golden Ratio or 2/3 rule to ensure proportionate and aesthetically pleasing spaces.
- Apply the 2/3 rule to the width of sofas, coffee tables, and artwork for a balanced look.
## One Light Source
- Relying on a single overhead light source makes the room look dingy and uninviting.
- Use a combination of ambient, task, and accent lighting.
- Mix ceiling, table, and floor lights at various heights and locations.
- Consider the temperature of light bulbs, preferring 2700 to 4000 Kelvin for living rooms.
- Use smart bulbs or dimmers for adjustable lighting intensity.
## Matching Furniture Sets
- Matching furniture sets can make the living room look like a showroom and lack personality.
- Mix and match new and vintage pieces, and experiment with shapes, colors, and personal touches.
- Look for common threads like material, style, or color to tie the room together.
- Don’t rush the process; take time to source pieces that you like and that will be useful.
## Not Layering
- A fully furnished room can feel flat due to a lack of layering.
- Introduce different textures, materials, shapes, tones, and scales for depth and richness.
- Contrast various elements like hard and soft, straight and curved, and dark and light.
- Add variety and contrast to avoid a flat and boring space.
- Pay attention to height, using tall lamps, plants, artwork, and curtains to add dimension.
## Not Considering Lifestyle
- Tailor the living room design to fit your lifestyle for functionality and enjoyment.
- Evaluate your needs and preferences before purchasing furniture.
- Ensure furniture is kid or pet-friendly if needed.
- Consider storage needs and traffic flow in the space.
- Choose pieces that align with your budget and preferences.
## Looks Over Comfort
- Don’t prioritize looks over comfort; ensure furniture is practical and comfortable.
- Avoid pieces that look good but aren’t comfortable or functional.
- Choose furniture that suits your lifestyle and is comfortable to use.
## Wrong Sized Rug
- A common mistake is getting a rug that is too small for the space.
- Ensure the rug is big enough to fit the front legs of sofas and armchairs, or all four legs.
- If the rug is too small, layer it with a larger plain rug underneath to rectify the size discrepancy.
## Not Considering Storage
- Clutter is the enemy of a well-decorated space.
- Use the 80/20 principle: keep 80% of items in closed storage and 20% on view.
- Add storage solutions like long units or custom pieces.
- Think vertically to maximize storage space.
- Utilize void spaces, such as under sofas, for additional storage.

    - **Scent**:
        - Scent has a massive impact on the atmosphere.
        - Options: candles, diffusers, essential oils, room spray, plants.

# How To Elevate Your Living Room
[Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K21ZLVcZKcc&list=PLZp7xLmGZu89JTdgobNKgEJgOu0rg5PaR&index=5)
## Intro
- Decorating your living room can feel daunting as it is one of the largest and most important areas of the home.
- The video covers common mistakes people make when designing their living rooms and provides design tips to elevate the space.
## Purchasing All Furniture From One Place
- Buying all furniture from one place makes the room look like a showroom, lacking personality.
- Combine pieces from various places within the same theme for a unified but interesting look.
- Variety makes the living room feel rich and layered.
- Example: Coffee table, side table, and TV unit in similar styles but different finishes.
- Avoid buying everything from one line as it limits the room's development over time.
- It allows for flexibility in replacing or upgrading pieces.
## Artworks or TV Too High
- Hanging artworks or mounting TVs too high creates an awkward gap and can cause neck strain.
- Artwork should be hung at eye level, roughly 150 cm from the center to the floor.
- Above furniture, artwork should be 10-15 cm above the piece, and above a sofa, 15-20 cm.
- Treat a gallery wall as a single piece of artwork for hanging.
- Use painters tape or paper cutouts to plan the arrangement before hanging.
- Avoid mounting TVs above fireplaces; if necessary, use an adjustable mount.
## Too Much Furniture
- Ensure there is enough space between furniture pieces to avoid a cramped atmosphere.
- General guideline: 75-90 cm walkways between large pieces, 45-60 cm for smaller spaces.
- Negative space is important for balance and focusing on specific objects.
- Avoid using furniture that is too large for the room, which can look heavy and suffocating.
## Too Small Rugs
- Small rugs feel awkward and make the room appear smaller.
- Rugs should ground the seating area, with either the front two legs or all legs of furniture on the rug.
- Rugs should be at least 15 cm wider than the sofa on both sides.
## Too Small Artworks
- Small artworks cheapen the look and highlight large blank spaces.
- Art above furniture should be half to two-thirds the width of the furniture.
- If unsure, bigger artwork is always better.
## Plan Ahead
- Take time to plan your design style, collect inspiration, take measurements, and set a budget.
- Avoid buying random pieces that don't go together.
- Repetition of colors, patterns, textures, or shapes creates cohesion.
## Incorporate Color or Contrast
- Adding contrast through color makes a space look more elevated and balanced.
- Use multiple shades, tints, or tones of a favorite color.
- A hint of black adds needed contrast while maintaining balance.
## Add Greenery
- Include indoor plants, faux greenery, flower bouquets, or simple branch arrangements.
- Greenery adds life and visual appeal to a room.
## Use Multiple Light Sources
- One light source is not enough; mix and layer accent, task, and ambient lighting.
- Use floor and table lamps to vary height and balance light throughout the room.
- Turn off harsh ceiling lights at night for a relaxing atmosphere.

## Intro
- Designing a room or apartment from scratch can be challenging due to the many factors involved, from color and design style to furniture size and placement.
- Often, this results in a place that feels disjointed, lacks personality, or looks like a showroom.
## Assessing the Space
- Before starting the design phase, assess the space by asking key questions:
    - What are the functional needs of the room (e.g., extra storage, workspace, dining area)?
    - Consider your lifestyle and how the space will be used (e.g., working from home, entertaining, cooking habits).
    - Determine if there are existing pieces to keep or part with.
    - Establish a budget to allocate funds wisely.
## Using Milanote for Organization

    - Rugs should be at least 15 cm wider than the sofa on both sides.
    - Front legs of the sofa and chairs should rest on the rug.
- Coffee tables should be half to two-thirds the length of the sofa.
- Add decor items to incorporate colors and contrast.
    - Combine warm and cool tones and include some neutrals.
## Final Styling

- Styling makes the room unique to you.
    - Experiment with lamps, books, and decorative objects.
    - Don’t be afraid to make changes until you are satisfied.
# How To Turn A Rental Into A Warm And Inviting Home
[Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQDs1Pd9Qtk&list=PLZp7xLmGZu89JTdgobNKgEJgOu0rg5PaR&index=13)
## Intro
- Designing a home that is warm and inviting is a common desire, but renting comes with limitations.
- This video covers principles to make your home warm and inviting, whether you rent or own.
## Lighting
- Good lighting is essential for a cozy atmosphere.
- Avoid using ceiling lights as the only source of light; they can be harsh and cast unflattering shadows.
- Mix different types of lighting: table lamps, floor lamps, overhead lamps, and ambient lighting such as light strips.
- Rental-friendly solutions don’t require drilling or routing cables.
- For homeowners, options include pendant lights, chandeliers, wall sconces, and track lighting.
- Warm light temperature is key for coziness.
- Smart lighting like Philips Hue bulbs allows you to dim and change the temperature through a phone, remote, or smart devices.
## Bring in Natural Elements
- Greenery adds warmth and a pop of color, brightening up a space.
- Options: live plants (purify air and look best if maintained), dried plants (low cost, zero maintenance), and faux greenery (avoid anything that looks too fake).
## Use Natural Materials
- Natural materials like wood bring instant warmth.
- Light-colored woods such as oak and birch provide a nice contrast to black furniture and metals.
- Add wooden elements through decor and kitchenware.
## Add Texture
- Texture adds depth and coziness.
- Use rugs to brighten the room, warm up your feet, and add personality.
- Rugs can also create zones in open-plan spaces.
- Comfortable slippers keep feet warm and reduce dirt and dust.
- Add texture with functional decor like pillows, throw blankets, and woven baskets.
## Hang Artwork and Mirrors
- Empty walls lack homeliness; artwork and mirrors help.
- No right or wrong amount of artwork, but ensure intentional placement.
- Fill about 2/3 to 3/4 of wall space with artwork.
- Hang artwork 4 to 12 inches above furniture.
- Command picture hanging strips are rental-friendly and allow adjustments.
- Mirrors reflect light and make rooms feel more spacious.
## Avoid Clutter
- A tidy house leads to a tidy mind.
- Organize everything and ensure each item has its place.
- Keep surfaces clean and perform daily tidying tasks.
- Use cable trunks and organizers to reduce visual clutter.
- Consider a floor TV stand for a hanging look without drilling.
## Fragrance and Scent
- Scented candles, potpourri, and diffusers keep your home smelling pleasant.
- Essential oil diffusers offer natural scents and health benefits.
- Fragrance oils are cheaper but lack health benefits.
- Open windows to let in fresh air for natural scent.
## Sound
- Background music enhances the ambiance, like in a coffee shop or restaurant.
- Inexpensive speakers can fill a room with sound.
- Sonos speakers allow for the same music to play across different rooms.
- Nature sounds are also effective for ambiance.
# How to Choose A Color Palette
[Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HafskVLxDKI)
## Intro
- Designing a home can be challenging due to many options and combinations for color palettes.
- This video covers the basics of color theory and steps to choose the perfect color palette.
## The Basics of Color Theory
- **Hues:** Colors on the color wheel divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary categories.
- **Tints, Tones, and Shades:** Created by altering hues with white, gray, or black.
    - Tint: Adding white
    - Tone: Adding gray
    - Shade: Adding black
- **Warm and Cool Tones:**
    - Cool tones: Blue, violet, green (calming, soothing)
    - Warm tones: Red, orange, yellow (cozy)
- **Color Schemes:**
    - Analogous: Three hues next to each other on the color wheel.
    - Complementary: Two opposite colors on the color wheel.
    - Monochromatic: Variations of a single color.
    - Triadic: Three colors evenly spaced on the color wheel.
## Choosing Color Palettes (7 Steps)
1. **Establish Mood:**
    - Decide the mood you want (calm, relaxing, warm, welcoming).
    - Assess current colors and their impact on your home’s atmosphere.
2. **Find Inspiration:**
    - Use Pinterest, mood boards, fashion, and personal preferences.
    - Determine whether you prefer neutrals, warm organic looks, or black and white schemes.
3. **Choose Dominant and Secondary Colors:**
    - Consider existing architecture and non-negotiables like fixed finishes.
    - Use tools like the Canva color wheel or color palette generator for guidance.
4. **Repeat Colors but with Variants:**
    - Use different tints, tones, and shades of the same color to create rhythm and visual interest.
5. **Combine Cool and Warm Tones:**
    - Balance cool and warm tones for a welcoming atmosphere.
    - Ensure variety within monochromatic or analogous schemes.
6. **Consider the 60-30-10 Rule:**
    - 60% dominant color (walls), 30% secondary color (furniture, rugs), 10% accent color (decor items).
7. **Test Out Your Chosen Colors:**
    - Use samples to see colors in different lighting conditions.
    - Paint swatch stickers can help visualize colors without residue.
## Low Commitment Ways to Add Color
- Use neutral bases (white walls, neutral furniture) and add color with:
    - Throw pillows, blankets, flowers, budget artwork, plants, and books.
- For more permanent changes:
    - Change cabinet or door hardware.
    - Paint existing doors or furniture.
- For larger but non-permanent changes:
    - Switch rugs, change curtains, or use removable wallpaper.

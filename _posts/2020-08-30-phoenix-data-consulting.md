## Motivation

One of the biggest problems that is facing the data science industry is the cost of utilizing data. The cost of utilization can be broken down into a few components:

- **Data collection**: physical sensors, human collectors, automatic collectors of data. Privacy and security are a huge concern
- **Data analysis**: crunching the numbers in the data, identifying trends and verifing that trends are statistically significant
- **Data-driven actions**: deriving and acting upon insight

There is a significant cost when it comes to labour and time. Unfortunately, this means that startups and non-profits, despite the data they have collected, are not in the optimal position to analyze the data.

Enter Phoenix Data Consulting. This is an idea that I have been toying around with since I my first internship at a data science startup. Using the resources and experience of University of Waterloo students, we could offer pro-bono data consulting services specifically for startups and non-profits. 

## What have we done so far?

We have launched a data visualization software for a large Canadian non-profit, allowing their team as well as hundreds of citizen scientists to monitor climate change signals from the Hudson Bay. We have also scoped some solutions for a growing Canadian startup in the ed-tech space.

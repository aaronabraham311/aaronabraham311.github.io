title: Sessions by SE
---

It is a known fact that the best resource when it comes to advice during your university years will be upper-year friends: they have been in the same spot as you and so they are in a unique position to advise.

There are several events in the University of Waterloo that try to create events where first-years can meet upper-years, from resume critiques to mentoring programs. The problem with all these approaches is retention: many people don't try to talk to mentors after their first interaction.

My friend Daekun suggested a unique idea to fix this issue: make a podcast series. Thus, I started a podcast series called Session by SE. The goal of this podcast series is to generate a resource where first-year students can pick podcasts which are most apt for them and gain upper-year advice at their convenience. Our podcasts have become popular within the SE community of Waterloo as we have crossed 1.1k listens as of April 2021.

Here are a couple of episodes that we have recorded:
- Running startups as an SE student
- Making the most out of our first co-op
- A playbook for first-year Software Engineering
- Interviews with alumni

Sessions can be found on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1nfOj5xxW9bSST1oMJvUxS) and on [Anchor](https://open.spotify.com/show/1nfOj5xxW9bSST1oMJvUxS). Hope you enjoy!

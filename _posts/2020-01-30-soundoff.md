I have always loved to tinker around with music and listen to new genres. While listening to some rock recommended by friends, I thought of using machine learning to classify songs based on the year it was created. Through spectrogram analysis, I found a load of interesting insights, from how tempo has changed across the years to the importance of zero-crossing rates in truly catchy songs.

This project can be broken into a couple of steps:

1. Download data: I downloaded over 1000 YouTube songs from different decades (70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s) using a simple Python script linked with youtube-dl
2. EDA: I used spectrogram analysis to uncover patterns in songs over the years
3. Statistical analysis: I used regression testing with Bonferonni correction to determine whether the patterns I uncovered in EDA were statistically significant
4. Modelling: this is still a work of progress. My initial model using Bayesian hyperparameter tuning was moderately accurate (~60%) but I intend to improve my models and my data sources

Skills/concepts used:
- Bayesian hyper parameter tuning
- Statistical regression testing
- Web scraping
- Model building and analysis
